            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Chriſtian Nobility doth not accept Perſons, and Conditions of men, but looketh into their Minds: From the manners she iudgeth a man to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile or noble.

            </p>
            <p>This faith as it is only gained by the free Guift of God, ſo is it only loſte by Infidelity and Hereſy, theſe being the oppoſites which deſtroy faith, and with which poſſibly ſhe cannot ſubſiſt. And if it be moſt true that euery Hereſy is a certaine Infidelity, and a true deniall of all faith; what ſhall we thinke of the Hereſy of this vnfortunate Age, by which the integrity of faith is not only violated in one or other Article, or thoſe of leſſe moment and neceſſity (which yet by no meanes were to be tolerated, but by all Chriſtian hartes to be deteſted and accurſed) but generally in all as it were by an vniuerſall deluge of Apoſtacy, euen in the pointes of greateſt waight
<pb facs="tcp:252:19"/> concerning God, Chriſt, the Church, her Sacrifice and Sacramentes, Mans Iuſtification, Grace, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, the Commandments, &amp; many other ſuch lyke; All which with ſingular impiety are ſo depraued and impugned by the Sectaries of theſe dayes, as that their Endeauours may ſeeme to ayme, and to be wholly imployed, inſteed of an Hereſy, to introduce with g eateſt boldnes, Madnes, and Malice, a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Apoſtacy or Atheiſme from the faith of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The ſerious Conſideration, and feeling Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration of this ſo great a miſchiefe, I muſt confeſſe (worthy Reader) was the mayne Motiue for my vndertaking and compyling this Treatiſe following: for whileſt I remembred, that without entyre diuine Faith, and true worſhip and Religion towards God, no Saluation was to be expected: and withall ſaw ſuch innumerable Soules (ſo dearly bought by the precious Bloud and death of Chriſt our Lord, Soules alſo moſt deare to me in ſundry other moſt iuſt reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectes) ſo continually to periſh through the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Hereſy; I could not forbeare, but after my humble Prayers, adde alſo my poore and vnworthy labours, which if through Gods bleſſing, they may proue ſo effectuall, as to reduce any ſeduced Soule to the ſtate of Saluation, I ſhall thinke them all moſt happily vndertaken, and ioyfully ſuſtayned, and my ſelfe plentifully rewarded at the holy Hand of God.</p>
            <p>Now, that my writings might proue more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and powerfull with the Prot.

<pb facs="tcp:252:20"/> in all Diſputes to appeale, and in all Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines to ſubſcribe; eſteeming, and making it his ſole Rule, and Square, wherby to be directed in all points of faith and Religion neceſſary to Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uation. To this alſo for the preſent I likewiſe appeale, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this the ſubiect of my whole Diſcourſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doubting, but to make it appeare, and that moſt cleerly, that the Written Word, is our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Word, ſpeaking and teaching our<note n="(7)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.8.</note> Roman faith, ſo anciently renowmed in the whole world.</p>
            <p>And that it may be rightly obſerued how diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent are the proceedings of Catholickes and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes, in the religious and ſincere handling and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this ſacred Word, I deſire briefly to giue a iuſt account, of the Method, and order which I haue preſcribed to my ſelfe, and is generally obſerued, throughout this whole Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, ſeeing the true ſtaring of the Matter in diſpute, doth of it ſelfe often diſcouer the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and falſhood of a bad Cauſe, and therfore all Heretickes do fraudulently ſet downe the ſtate of the Queſtion, changing and peruerting the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning therof, therby the better to hyde their owne Errors, &amp; to traduce their Aduerſaries; I haue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in preuention herof, in the firſt place euer ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Controuerſy aright, ſhewing what the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church doth teach and belieue as matter of faith, and this from her ſacred Councels &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued Doctors: and what ſhe permitteth her Schoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemen to diſpute as pointes indifferent, not defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by her Decrees: for with theſe I fynd our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Sectaries<note n="(8)" place="margin">D. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, White, Featley.</note> greatly to delude their Vulgar Readers, vrging theſe Schoole differences, as though
<pb facs="tcp:252:20"/> they were Differences in Articles, and Concluſions of faith, which to affirme, is a <hi>Grand Imposture,</hi> much frequented by D. Morton, who for want of better matter, ſtoreth and ſtuffeth his writinges with toyes in this kind</p>
            <p>But not content with this, it is ordinary with Proteſtantes in their Sermons and Writings, moſt fowly to bely our Catholicke Cauſe, aſcribing vnto vs infinite groſſe, and moſt abſurd opinions, which we vtterly deteſt and deryde: they intending by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious vntruthes to diſgrace that, which with ſound Argumentes they are not able to confute. I giue plentifull Examples of this bad dealing throughout this whole Booke.</p>
            <p>Hauing thus cleered our Catholicke Doctrine, I next ſet downe what Prot. teach concerning the point in Controuerſy. In which I fynd them often at deadly wars amongſt themſelues, and that not for Points diſputable and indifferent, but for the Chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Articles, and Concluſions of Faith, the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe wherof is neceſſary to Saluation. In theſe their differences, I ordinarily ſet downe for Prot. Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, that which is moſt commonly taught by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Prot. Church; or by ſuch others, as are moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned amongſt their Brethren, for their ſuppoſed Wiſdome, and Learning.</p>
            <p>But in thus ſearching what their opinions are, I ſtill obſerue, and accordingly proue, that wherin they diſagree from the Catholicke faith, therin they do agree with ſome Ancient Hereticke, formerly confuted, and condemned by Councels and Fathers.</p>
            <p>And not only this, but I fynd further, that they runne themſelues vpon fundry groſſe Errors, which
<pb facs="tcp:252:21"/> were not euen dreamed on by any former Heretikes, and which once admitted, would ineuitably inferre a generall Apoſtacy from the Chriſtian faith. This is the Courſe which I generally vſe for the true expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the point in Controuerſy; which point thus cleered, I addreſſe my ſelfe in the nexte place to ſuch proofes for the Catholicke cauſe, as the ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures do plentifully affoard: from whence yet I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produce ſuch textes, as being taken in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, ſimple, and literall ſignification, do ſpeake moſt plainly for the Catholicke Truth. But becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſpoken in termes ſo playne, but what the wit and malice of the Deuill and his Miniſters will in ſome ſorte depraue, inuenting for that end ſome Euaſion or other, therby to weaken the force of the wordes being taken in their proper ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I do therfore alſo take notice of theſe poore ſhiftes, and do further ſhew, that they are mere fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes, faigned and taught without all ground or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of truth, wholly impertinent, often ridiculous, and euer ſuch, as with the like liberty, any Hereſy though neuer ſo forlorne may eaſily be defended, &amp; any Article of our Chriſtian faith, though neuer ſo neceſſary, be dangerouſly impugned.</p>
            <p>But neither is this detorting of the wordes of Scripture from their proper meaning, the greateſt iniury now adayes offered to the word of God: For Sectaries further proceed, when all other meanes faile them, moſt accurſedly to corrupt the ſacred wordes and ſentences of Gods diuine word, adding wordes of their owne ſtamping to the holy textes, omitting, or taking away ſome of the ſacred-words themſelues, miſtranſlating wordes, making them to
<pb facs="tcp:252:21"/> ſpeake thinges moſt different, and repugnant from their owne proper ſignification. And if all this will not ſerue their turne, through the euidence &amp; fulnes of Scripture condemning their Errors, then they betake themſelues to that laſt moſt deſperate &amp; dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Refuge, of that Atheiſticall denying, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Apocryphall whole entyre Bookes of holy Writ: which impious freedome, if it might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, would ſhortly diſcharge the whole Canon of Scripture from any Scripture at all.</p>
            <p>But becauſe it is another vſuall ſhifte vſed by Proteſtantes, to fly from the wordes to the ſenſe, that neither they, nor we, as partiall Iudges, ſhould giue ſentence therof; I do therfore appeale for the fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of the true ſenſe of the Scriptures to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, and Expoſitions made by the Ancient Fathers, who liuing in the pureſt tymes of the Church, neighbouring vpon the Apoſtles, flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing in learning, ſhining in ſanctity, and ignorant of our preſent Contentions, may in all reaſon be thought, &amp; accepted for Iudges moſt competent, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt, and impartiall. Neither do I produce theſe as barely affirming what themſelues thought or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, or ſpake in heat of diſputation againſt their Aduerſaries, but what they dogmatically taught in their Commentaries, Expoſitions, and Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſacred Scriptures: or what is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, confeſſed, and diſliked in them by Prot. as making vnanſwerably for our Catholicke faith, and ſtrongly confuting, and condemning the Prot. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
            <p>Neither do I wholly reſt in this manner of proofe, though ſuperabundant for my Cauſe: But
<pb facs="tcp:252:22"/> I likewiſe in greateſt ſurpluſſage adioyne herunto, the aboundant Interpretations of Scriptures made by Prot. writers, moſt agreable to the former made by Fathers, and wholly confirming our Catholicke faith, and therin impugning their other Brethren who oppoſe againſt it. Now, if the Textes of ſacred Scriptures, taken in their proper and literall ſenſe, and the anſwerable Expoſitions made by the holy Fathers, and ſundry of the learnedſt Prot. writers, do all of them conſpire in making that ſenſe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which wholly agreeth with the doctrine and practiſe of the Catholicke Roman Church; I do not ſee what more can be required by any indifferent, &amp; vnderſtanding man, for the making it to appeare cleere, as the ſunne at Noone day, that the Written Word of God is that which teacheth vs our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke faith, and confuteth and condemneth ſuch Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and hereſyes as aryſe againſt it.</p>
            <p>Laſtly ſeeing, all this notwithſtanding, Prot. do not deſiſte to obiect ſome darker paſſages of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture againſt others moſt plaine, and for ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by Fathers &amp; Prot; I do therfore not forbeare to take notice of them, but withall do plainly ſhew, that the ſaid textes taken in their literall ſenſe, do nothing make againſt vs, and ſo moſt impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vrged; and being explayned by other plainer pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, do ſtrongly make againſt themſelues who vrge them. And if not the wordes but the ſenſe, muſt be regarded, then I frequently alleadge both Fathers and Prot. ſo expounding the ſame, as that their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are full anſwers to what is obiected by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prot. So weakely, and not at all, is Hereſy truly grounded vpon the word of God.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:252:22"/>
            <p>This, Chriſtian Reader, is the courſe obſerued by me through this whole worke, which whether I be iudged duly to performe or no, I moſt willingly leaue to the diſpaſſionate Cenſure of the Iudicious: who will eaſily herby perceiue, that Prot. pretending to fly to the Scriptures, as their only refuge, do ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in make flight to their mortall Enemy, who cutteth their throates. That which for my poore paynes at the handes of the good Reader I ſhall only requeſt, is, that all former preiudicate opinion againſt Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Religion ſet apart, and all baſe and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy feare of temporall loſſes in Honours, Eſtates, or Liberties couragiouſly ſhaken off, that he firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, and conſtantly profeſſe that only Faith, and Religion which Gods diuine Word doth teach, the holy Fathers do confirme, and ſundry of the learnedſt Prot do acknowledge for true: which doing, he ſhall gayne that faith, without which, according to the Apoſtle,<note n="(9)" place="margin">

               <p>The next thing to be examined, is, which of theſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes do affoard a forcible Argument for the eſtabliſhing any truth in matter of fayth and Religion.

And ſo it is generally taught by Diuines, that, <hi>Theologia Symbolica non eſt argumentatiua, ſymbolicall or myſticall Diuinity doth not yield a strong Argument:</hi> which truth they haue learned from S.

               <p>Seeing then a good Argument cannot ordinarily be framed from the myſticall or ſpirituall Senſe; Let vs now ſee what authority beareth the Litterall: In which, it is our generall doctrine, that ſeeing it is certayne, that Senſe which is immediatly gathered from the wordes to be Senſe of the holy Ghoſt, that therfore from the literal ſenſe are we to take Arguments that will be efficacious: And ſo accordingly

And this with great reaſon, for if thoſe textes of Scripture which being literally taken, are not directly againſt any other playner Scripture or Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of faith, may be peruerted and turned into Tropes and figures, then as Melancthon well obſerueth,<note n="(13)" place="margin">L.

                  <hi>All things may be peruerted:</hi> Yea faith it ſelfe will periſh, and all diuine Myſteries depend only vpon opinion, and ſo the way laid
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:252:45"/> open to infinite errours.</p>
               <p>A fourth Rule approued by Catholikes &amp; Proteſtants is this: that, when the Scripture doth ſpecially inſtruct vs in the Doctrine of the Holy Sacraments, in the inſtitution or publiſhing of Gods peculiar Commandements, or in any principall Article of faith, then that ſenſe is to be holden good, for proofe of which the words are moſt plaine and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terall. But for the right vnderſtanding of this, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, that although our Sauiour in his ordinary Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or preaching to the people, which did imply a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, did ſometimes to ſtirre them vp to greater atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion, remember them in figuratiue words of ſome generall duty or Commandment, not then firſt preſcribed, but formerly knowne and commanded; yet the firſt promulgation of euery peculiar Commandement is euer deliuered in words plaine, not figuratiue or obſcure. And as touching doctrines, it is not meant hereby, that euery ſentence or opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God is euer to be vnderſtood according to the literall words, but onely that ſuch as comprehend in them a ſpeciall difficulty or neceſſity for vs to beleiue, or practiſe; ſuch as are the Articles of our faith, which are ſet downe and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered in plaine words, and ſo to be vnderſtood. Wherefore ſuch examples of God being a <hi>Conſuming fire,</hi> of Chriſt being a <hi>stone, a lyon, a vyne, a doore,</hi> and the like, are of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not importing any principle or Article of faith or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>Againe, in the ſecluding of Tropes and figures, it is not intended that euery figuratiue locution ſhould be ſecluded, but onely ſuch as is obſcure and darke, for there be ſome which are in themſelues no leſſe eaſie and manifeſt then the other: As for example to ſay, <hi>The Cup is shed,</hi> Euery one knoweth (as Beza<note n="(14)" place="margin">In Mat. <hi>26.28.</hi>
                  </note> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſeth) that thereby is mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t not the Cup it ſelfe, but the thing contayned in the Cup. And this, and ſuch like are ſometimes vſuall, but yet their ſenſe is knowne and manifeſt.</p>
               <p>This Rule thus vnderſtood, is acknowledged by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to be good: ſo Vrſinus preſcribeth that,<note n="(15)" place="margin">Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Catech. fol. <hi>416.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And as this Rule ſtandeth good for the vnderſtanding of ſuch Scriptures as inſtruct vs in the Inſtitution of Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and Commandementes, and in the neceſſary Article of fayth: So alſo may it ſerue for the fynding out of the true ſenſe of any other Text, in which the vſuall and Literal ſenſe is euer true; if ſo the ſaid ſenſe make not againſt ſome other plainer places of Scripture, or be contrary to ſome Article of fayth, or oppoſite to the general vnderſtanding of the Church, or therwith it inferre ſome groſſe and plaine abſurdity. Theſe Rules preſcribed and approued both by Catholickes and Prot. if they likewiſe be obſerued in the

But the anſwere is eaſy, for firſt by the word, <hi>Iudge,</hi>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:252:54"/> we may wel vnderſtand the chiefe or high Prieſt, for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Hebrew it is ſaid; <hi>Aſcend to the Priests, and to the Iudge,</hi> as if it had been ſaid, Aſcend to the Councel of Prieſts, and their Prince the high Prieſt.

                  <p>This anſwere then not ſatisfying, other Proteſtants ſeeke to euade by affirming barely that the forſayd Law of Deutronomy concerned only matters ciuill, not ſpirituall or directly tending to God. But beſids that the law was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, concerning all doubts aryſing from the law, and the text ſayth in generall, <hi>betweene cauſe and cauſe;</hi> ſeeing heer it is euident that the people are referred by God to the high Prieſt, for the determining of their difficulties; how abſurd &amp; diſtaſting would it be to our politick State, if our Engliſh Clergy ſhould affirme, that the deciſion of temporall and Ciuill ſuits were to be referred to the Prieſt or the Church? Yea how ſeuerely would Biſhops and Miniſters be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, if they ſhould but endeauour to aſſume any ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended authority?</p>
                  <p>Others obſeruing that none of the foreſayd euaſions do ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy ſo plaine texts of Scripture, as not being able to deny the words to be moſt euident, do therefore, as acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the ſame, yet further anſwere; that many things eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the old Law, are now abrogated by the new, and therefore, an argument drawne from the decrees &amp; pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe thereof, to be now inualide, in regard of our tyme of grace. But this alſo is as inſufficient as the former anſwers; for although many things vſed in the old Law, being Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, be now abrogated; yet that maketh no more againſt the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge now, then it doth againſt the Iudge in Ciuill cauſes, or the temporall Magiſtrats, which were appointed by God, and exerciſed their authority during the old Law: and therefore moſt things then preſcribed, not being Ceremoniall, are ſtill with vs Chriſtians, though not

                  <p>But all this is yet more fully explained and confirmed by holy King Ioſaphat, who hauing appointed Prieſts in Hieruſalem, ſayd thus vnto them;<note n="(14)" place="margin">2. <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. c.</hi> 19. 10. 11.</note>

And agreably to this we ſhall ſee shortly, that the Apoſtle<note n="(21)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11.</note> affirmeth, that now in the Church <hi>Christ hath placed not only Apostles, Prophets, and Euangelists,</hi> but alſo next after them <hi>Pastors and Doctors:</hi> The diuine Prouidence diſpoſing, that we ſhould haue not only the ſacred writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Prophets, and Euangeliſts, but alſo the Commentaries, Interptetations, and Preachings of Paſtors and Doctors, in explanation therof. Which <hi>Paſtors and Doctors</hi> (as Caluin<note n="(22)" place="margin">Inſtit. c. <hi>5.</hi> de fide.</note> gathereth vpon this place) <hi>haue an ordinary Charge in the Church, and the Church can neuer want them, but euermore,</hi> as he ſayth, <hi>Doctores praeſunt Scripturae interpretationi</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Doctors haue authority to interpret the Scriptures, that ſincere and wholſome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine may be retayned among the faithfull.</hi> So falſe it is, that the externall Iudgment granted in the old Law, is now abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by the New.</p>
                  <p>Now this courſe of deciding Controuerſies by the Prieſts or the Church, being ſo generally preſcribed and practiſed in the old Law, was in it ſelfe ſo good and profitable, that Chriſt at his comming approued and confirmed the ſame, ſaying,<note n="(23)" place="margin">

Where I cannot but note the ſpeciall prouidence &amp; care of God ouer his Church, who though he ſometyme permit the Superiours and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates thereof, to be of ſinnefull &amp; ſcandalous lyfe, yet he euer ſo preſerued them from teaching falſe doctrine to the people, as that he commandeth theſe ſtill to follow their teaching, though their workes be bad: which in his goodnes and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome he would not do, if in like ſort he permitted them to erre in fayth and doctrine, as in lewdnes of lyfe; but rather to the contrary would giue them Counſayle, to take good heed both of their doctrine and lyfe. To conclude then, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ordinance and pactiſe of the old Law; If the cauſe to haue Controuerſies ended be as vrgent now, as during the Old Teſtament, and the danger of errour as grieuous; then if the People were not referred to the written word, or the Priuate Spirit, for the decyding of their doubts, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to a viſible and knowne Iudge, to wit, the Prieſts; may Chriſtians,<note n="(24)" place="margin">

                  <p>There are alſo in the ſacred Scriptures obſcure figures and parables almoſt innumerable.

                  <p>And if (as Luther affirmeth)<note n="(12)" place="margin">Praef. aſſert. Artic. à Leone dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natorum.</note> 
                     <hi>the Scriptures be more cleer then the Commentaries of all the Fathers,</hi> and as other Prot. make ſo eaſy, that the vulgar people may vnderſtand them by their owne reading, to what end then the Fathers not only heertofore, but euen Proteſtants now continually do write ſo many Commentaries in explanation thereof? But chiefly ſeeing Prot. decyde all Controuerſies only by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, how aryſe ſo daily and deadly diſſentions among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, concerning things taught and ſet downe in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, if the Scriptures be ſo eaſy as is pretended?</p>
                  <p>To theſe demands two things are vſually anſwered; firſt, that though the Scripture be moſt cleer, yet it is darke to the proud and vnbelieuing, by reaſon of their blindnes, and wicked affection. Secondly, that though in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it be obſcure, yet the ſelfeſame thing is cleerly ſet down in other places. But by the firſt it followeth, that Luther himſelfe (who giueth theſe reaſons) is a Proud man and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel, it being euident, and for ſuch euen by Prot. acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:252:80"/> that he taught and maintayned ſundry groſſe errors, and in all for his defence pretending Scriptures. And by the like reaſon the ſame crymes of Pride and Infidelity incurre all Lutherans, by the iudgement of Caluiniſts, and all Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiniſts by the iudgement of Lutherans; &amp; ſo the like may be affirmed of our Proteſtants and Puri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And againſt the ſecond I vrge firſt, that ſundry obſcure places, haue not coherence with any other place; as the greateſt part of the Apocalyps, and the beginning and end of the Prophet Ezechiel. Secondly though it were true, yet a true conference of places amongſt themſelues, is a thing of it ſelfe very difficult; for that place which a Caluiniſt would thinke to be cleere, and therefore other places con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame matter to be expounded thereby; a Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran will auouch to be obſcure, and other places to be more plaine. Beſides this, it is alſo very difficult alwayes truly to diſcerne whether the places ſo conferred do ſpeake of one and the ſame thing, ſeeing the ſame word, and almoſt the ſame phraze is vſed in Scriptures to ſignify diuers things, as the Scripture<note n="(13)" place="margin">Baptiſme is ſometi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes vſed for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſme, othertimes for Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance or Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.

                  <p>Fourthly, this foreſaid Conference is only a Coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble refuge of words, wherby to make, not the Scripture our Iudge, but ourſelues Iudge of the Scripture: for to Conferre and apply the Scriptures, and therby to determine the right ſenſe, is in vs an acte of our vnderſtanding, euen as it is the like to confer our temporall lawes: wherfore if the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only without our conference therof, do not determine to vs the true meaning of it ſelfe, then is it no more our Iudge in Matters of faith, then the law is in temporall cauſes: And then further, if euery one of vs be to vndertake this Conference for himſelfe, without relying vpon the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Iudgment of any Interpreter, further then we our ſelues can diſcerne the ſame to be true by our Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, (as many Proteſtants<note n="(30)" place="margin">Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius de ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra Script. p. 412.

A cleere Example hereof Proteſtants haue in their Lutheran and Puritane Brethren, of whom they muſt needs confeſſe, that concerning ſuch Errors as they lay to their charge, they make themſelues Iudges of the Scripture, and not the Scripture their Iudge.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth it ſuffice to anſwere, that they defend not an erroneous, but a ſincere Conference: for the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conference maketh the Scripture no more Iudge, then doth the right conference of the lawes, make the Law to be our Iudge. And as for the different kinds of erroneous and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:252:82"/> rightfull Conference, they do equally and alike admit our Iudgment and act of conferring, only the nature of this conference is ſeuerally altered, according to the ſincerity or errour therof. So that as Proteſtants muſt needs confeſſe of their foreſaid Brethren, that they in their ſaid Erroneous conference make not the Scripture their Iudge, but themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues Iudges, though erroneous Iudges of the Scriptures mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: In like manner in their owne Conference, they make themſelues (though in their opinion rightly Iudges, yet) Iudges and determiners therof. Wherupon it followeth, that Proteſtants whether learned or vnlearned, conferring the Scriptures either ſincerely or erroneouſly, do neuertheles in the ſaid Conferences make themſelues Iudges of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and not the Scripture their Iudge.</p>

And ſo K.

Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly the difference of the old Teſtament from the new, conſiſteth in this, that the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Chriſt were not then vnderſtood, and therefore the Booke was ſayd to be ſealed, as well to the learned as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, whereas now in the new, Chriſt hauing fulfilled the figures and Prophecies, though many do not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Sentences of Scripture, yet yong Children and ignorant women, do know the myſteries of our Redemption.

                     <hi>Where you ſay the Beroeans are commended by the holy Ghoſt, for not belieuing that which Paul ſpoke of Religion, till they had examined by Scriptures, and ſeen whether the truth were ſo as he vttered, you ſpeake not only vnwiſely, and vntruly, but if you would haue Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to follow that Courſe, you shew intollerable pride against the word of God: for the Beroeans were commended, (whereas yet they neyther belieued in Chriſt, nor acknowledged Pauls Apostleship) for their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines to heare, and care to ſearch, whether Paul ſpoke true or no. This if you now aſſume to your ſelfe ouer Paules words or writings, you incurre the crime of flat impiety: Paules words to vs that belieue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further ſearch or other credit, are of equall authority with the reſt of the Scriptures, and not to belieue him, till we examine and ſee the truth of his Doctrine, is meer infidelity;</hi> So confeſſedly imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent is this common obiection.</p>

The fountayns or originalls are to be preferred before Tranſlations, when it is certayne that the fountaynes are pure, and not troubled or corrupt; but it is moſt certayne, that they are in ſome places corrupted.

                  <p>We do not read that the Apoſtles were ſent to <hi>write,</hi> but to <hi>preach,</hi> and ſo accordingly all of them preached, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the greater part of them writ nothing at all.

                  <p>This truth yet further appeareth by order of their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, for the Euangeliſts did not purpoſely ſet downe in their Ghoſpels principles of fayth, but penned only hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and by way of Narration, a briefe abſtract of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours Acts, eſpecially thoſe wherin were fulfilled the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies fortold of him.

                        <hi>C.</hi> 17.3.</note> Acts, where the hiſtory is written, and thoſe Traditions ſet downe, that S. Paul preached to the Theſſalonians, that, <hi>it behoued Chriſt to ſuffer, and to ryſe againe,</hi> and that he is <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle preached. Now, this Doctrine being the Tradition, which he meant in the place obiected, and which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered to them by word, is manifeſtly contayned, though not in his ſaid Epiſtle to the Theſſalonia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, yet in other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. But the weaknes of this Anſwere appeareth many wayes, for firſt it is without colour, vnleſſe it could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the Apoſtle by thoſe Traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s deliuered by word, did vnderſtand only that doctrine, which is here alleadged
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:252:116"/> out of the Actes, which D. Reinolds neither doth, nor could proue. Secondly the Doctrine alleadged out of the Actes, was before written by him to the Theſſalonians themſelues in his firſt Epiſtle, wherin he inſtructeth them touching out Sauiour, that he is<note n="(83)" place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.15.19.</note>

Thirdly the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid anſwere is without all probability, vnleſſe it can be ſhewed that all the doctrine which S. Paul taught the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians, is wholly expreſſed in that place of the Actes; for if all be not there written, how then can it from thence be knowne, what thoſe Traditions deliuered by word are, wherof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in his ſaid Epiſtle to the Theſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalonians. And that all ſuch Doctrine as S.

                  <p>And I verily perſuade my ſelfe, that it is not vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of obſeruation, that though we ſearch into all Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, Councels, Fathers, and hiſtories, we ſhall not find that any other of the Apoſtles but S.

                  <p>Another ſtrong proofe of S. Peters Primacy, is taken from this promiſe of Chriſt made vnto him,<note n="(11)" place="margin">

                     <hi>And I ſay alſo vnto thee, thou art Peter, and vpon this Rocke I will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not preuayle agaynst it:</hi> And, <hi>I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the Kingdome of heauen, and whatſoeuer thou shalt bind vpon Earth, shalbe bound in heauen, and whatſoeuer thou shalt looſe on Earth, shal be looſed in heauen.</hi> Out of this place foure principall points may be proued; firſt, that Peter was that Rock or foundation vpon which Chriſt promiſed to build his Church. Secondly, that to be the foundation of the Church, is to be the Gouernour of the Church. Thirdly, that the ſayd Peter it was, to whome Chriſt promiſed to giue the keyes of the Kingdome of Heauen. And laſtly that by thoſe keyes is vnderſtood the full power of gouerning the Church.</p>
                  <p>The firſt point is proued ſundry wayes, as firſt by the pronowne <hi>(this)</hi> which demonſtrateth ſome <hi>Rocke</hi> wherof Chriſt had ſpoken a little before: now, immediatly before
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:252:126"/> Chriſt had called <hi>Peter</hi> a <hi>Rocke,</hi> for he ſpake in Siriacke, in which language <hi>Peter</hi> ſignifieth a <hi>Rocke,</hi> according to that in S. Iohn,<note n="(12)" place="margin">

And this is but agreable with that Catholike Doctrine, which teacheth that Peters fayth in two regards is called the Rocke of the Church: firſt becauſe for the merit therof, Peter obtained that he was to be the Rock of the Church. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, in that Peter is therefore chiefly the Rocke of the Church, that ſeeing his faith could not fayle, he was to ſtrengthen and confirme all others in fayth, for ſo our Sauiour ſayd to him,<note n="(22)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 22.32.</note> 
                     <hi>I haue prayed for thee, that thy fayth fayle not, and thou ſometymes conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, confirme thy Brethren:</hi> Therefore, ſeeing that Peter by reaſon of this indefectible fayth, is a moſt ſtrong Rock, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning the whole Church, it is all one then to ſay, vpon Peter, and vpon his fayth, the Church to be builded, and in thoſe reſpects, may we truly ſay, the Church to be builded vpon Peters Faith, or Confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Now, the ſecond way wherby Faith and Confeſſion may be vnderſtood, is barely of themſelues without all refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Peters perſon, and in this ſenſe Proteſtants vrge it: but it is falſe, for then our Sauiour would not haue ſaid, <hi>v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this Rocke I will build,</hi> but, <hi>I do,</hi> and haue built my Church, for as then already many had belieued him to haue bene the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:252:127"/> ſonne of the liuing God, as the Old Prophets, the B. Virgin Mary, Simeon, Zacharias, his Apoſtles and Diſciples. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Faith</hi> ſo taken is rightly ſaid (according to<note n="(23)" place="margin">Serm. <hi>22.</hi> de verb. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post.</note> S. Auſtine) <hi>to be the foundation of our Iuſtification,</hi> and all vertues, not of the Church; for the foundation and the reſt of the building muſt be both of the ſame kind. Now the Church is a Congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men, as it were<note n="(24)" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5.</note> of liuely ſtones, therfore the ſtone which muſt be the foundation, muſt be ſome man, not any vertue. Thirdly, all words of the Text do plainly argue, that ſome Priuiledge or peculiar authority was giuen to Peter for that his Confeſſion; all which were taken away, if that only fayth of Chriſt (which was common as then to others with him) were only the Rocke of the Church.</p>
                  <p>S. Peter then being the Rocke whereupon Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to build his Church, the next thing to be declared is, that to be the Rocke or foundation of the Church, is to be the chiefe Paſtor or Gouernour therof; that the foundation in a building, is as the head in a Body, a gouernour in a Citty, and a king in his kingdome. For the prouing herof we muſt note, that in holy Scriptures the Church or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of faithfull, is called<note n="(25)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.6.</note> 
                     <hi>the houſe of Christ, and</hi>
                     <note n="(26)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Gods building;</hi> now as the reſt of the building in a materiall houſe, dependeth of the foundation, as vpon that which wholy vphouldeth it; ſo in that ſpirituall building of the Church (which Chriſt promiſed to found vpon a Rock, &amp; which Rock we haue proued to be Peter) the ſame depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon that Rock wherupon it is founded. Now what other dependance can be imagined, betweene the reſt of the Church, &amp; Peter their foundation, then that vpon him, as a firme Rock, they ſhould wholy rely in all matters of fayth and Religion, to be inſtructed, gouerned, and confirmed, &amp; ſo euer vpholden and ſuſtained in true fayth, againſt all the ſtormes of falſe Doctrines, and the Profeſſours therof.</p>
                  <p>But ſome reply, that as Peter here, is called the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, ſo are likewiſe the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles in other<note n="(27)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.14.</note> places. Anſw. They are called ſo indeed in three reſpects; firſt, in that they were the firſt, as well as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that planted Churches, and conuerted Countryes to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:252:127"/> Chriſt, in which ſenſe they are ſo called in the<note n="(28)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.14.</note> Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps. Secondly, in that the faith of the Church dependeth vpon the Reuelarion which the Prophets and Apoſtles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from God, and which they by their preaching and writing,, haue left to Poſterity, and ſo they are called foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations by S. Paul; and in theſe two reſpects all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were equall. Thirdly in regard of Gouerment, for they were all Rectors and Paſtors of the whole Church, but not in the ſame manner that S. Peter, he being as an Ordinary Paſtor, from whom (as ſhalbe hereafter<note n="(29)" place="margin">See hereafter.</note> proued) the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly ſucceſſion of true Paſtors, was to continue vntill the end of the world, they only but as Apoſtles, or Legates for the tyme. And in this reſpect (which pertayneth only to the preſent Controuerſy) as alſo in that Peter was the head or chiefe amongſt the Apoſtles themſelues, the Church is ſaid to be built vpon Peter, &amp; not vpon the reſt of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>The third Principall point therfore remayning to be proued, is, That thoſe words, <hi>To thee I will giue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen,</hi> are meant of Peter. And in truth ſo many words of the Text it ſelfe do ſo plainly ſhow it, as a man would more admire, that any ſhould deny it, then much trouble himſelfe in ſeeking to proue it: for who rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>Bleſsed art thou Simon, the ſonne of Ionas &amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>I ſay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vnto thee, thou art Peter &amp;c.</hi> And, <hi>I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen,</hi> would not ſay, that to Simon, who was afterwards called Peter, the ſaid keyes were giuen?</p>
                  <p>But ſome conceite, that whatſoeuer is here ſaid to Peter belongeth to the whole Church, which he only at that tyme did repreſent. But for anſwere hereto, we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that two wayes Peter may be ſaid to beare the perſon of the Church; firſt hiſtorically, which is, when one hauing done a thing himſelfe, doth alſo therin repreſent a thing to be done by another, as Abraham hauing indeed two ſonnes, did therin alſo repreſent, that God was to haue two people, as S. Paul<note n="(30)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.24.</note> expoundeth. Secondly parabolically, when nothing truly done is propoſed, but ſomething alike is fey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned, to ſignify another thing, as in the Ghoſpell, he that <hi>ſowed good ſeed,</hi> ſignified Chriſt preaching. And in the firſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:252:128"/> ſenſe, it is true, that Peter as then repreſented the Church, in that to him were giuen the keyes, which after were to be Communicated to the Church: but this maketh not againſt, but with vs; vnleſſe we will ſay, that Abraham had not two ſonnes, becauſe therein he repreſented God to haue two people. And that it is not to be vnderſtood in the ſecond ſenſe, is plaine, aſwell that euery circumſtance doth (as it were) marke out the very particular perſon of Peter, as alſo in that to the ſame, it is ſaid, <hi>To thee I will giue the keyes &amp;c.</hi> to whom it is ſaid immediatly after (verſe 29.) <hi>Go after me Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> for the name <hi>Peter</hi> is alike in both places; and that by Sathan, is meant Peters perſon is playne, and for ſuch<note n="(31)" place="margin">Hilar. de Trinit. l. <hi>6.</hi> &amp; <hi>10.</hi> &amp; in Pſ. <hi>131.</hi> Aug. l. <hi>2.</hi> cont. duas ep.

                  <p>It is further replied, that as to Abraham<note n="(33)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.9</note> 
                     <hi>Fayth was imputed to iustice,</hi> ſo alſo it is imputed to all others that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, therfore if Peter receiued the keyes becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſt, then all ſuch as confeſſe Chriſt, ſhall likewiſe receiue them. Anſw. Abraham by fayth was not only iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but alſo made<note n="(34)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17.</note> 
                     <hi>a Father of many Nations,</hi> and yet all ſuch as belieue are not made ſuch Fathers. The anſwere therfore is, that faith of its owne nature doth lead and bring a man to Iuſtice, if other things neceſſary thereunto be not wanting, as Hope, Charity &amp;c. But Confeſſion of Chriſt
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:252:128"/> doth not of its owne nature lead a man to receiue the keys, for ſundry other wayes might Chriſt haue rewarded Peter worthily for his Confeſſion, if it had ſo pleaſed his heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>Some demaund whether Peter dying, the keyes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned in the Church, or ceaſed with him? If the firſt, then they were giuen to the Church; if the ſecond, then no man now hath authority to looſe or bynd. Or thus, When the Pope is choſen, he eyther bringeth the keyes with him, or not; if the firſt, then he was Pope before he was made; if the ſecond, from whence had he them? Did ſome Angell bring them from heauen, or rather did he not receyue them from the Church, to whome they were giuen in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning? Anſw. Peter, or the Pope dying, the keyes do not periſh, neyther remayne formally in the Church but only as they are communicated to inferiour Paſtours, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne in the hands of Chriſt: and when a new Pope is choſen, he doth not bring them with him, neyther are they giuen him by the Church, but by Chriſt, neyther by any new deliuery, but by his auncient Inſtitution. Euen as a King when he doth place a Vice-roy ouer ſome Country, ſhould withall make knowne, that it is his Royall pleaſure, that the ſayd Viceroy dying, the Country ſhall chooſe and nominate another, to whome he already giueth the ſame power and authority, as to the former.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is obiected, that as heer to Peter are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the keyes, ſo the ſame authority to be promiſed to the<note n="(35)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18.</note> reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>Whatſoeuer you shall bynd vpon earth, shalbe bound in heauen, and whatſoeuer you shall looſe &amp;c.</hi> Anſw. As before it is ſhewed in what ſenſe they are truly called foundations, ſo heer likewiſe they are ſayd to haue authority to bynd &amp; looſe, but that this was giuen to them, not as to ordinary Paſtours, but only as to Legates for the tyme, and withall with certayne ſubordination to Peter, ſhalbe ſhewed heerafter. And I wiſh only, that it may be further obſerued, that Chriſt ſpeaking of one matter, to one perſon, in one and the ſame ſentence, to whomeſoeuer he made the firſt promiſe, to him he made the reſt. Therefore
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:252:129"/> if he promiſed the keies to all the Apoſtles, vpon them all he promiſed to build his Church, and not vpon himſelfe. Or if he promiſed to build his Church vpon himſelfe, to himſelfe he promiſed the keies of the kingdome of heauen, to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe he promiſed all power of bynding and looſing, which had bene as impertinent to our Sauiours diſcourſe, as diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant from truth: for Chriſt had all that power before giuen by his Father, when he was firſt ſent.</p>
                  <p>The laſt principall thing then to be proued, is, that by giuing the <hi>keies</hi> to Peter, is vnderſtood the giuing of the chiefe authority ouer the whole Church vnto him; for by <hi>keyes,</hi> is vnderſtood<note n="(36)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.22.</note>

                     <hi>And his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality is vpon his shoulder;</hi> for therefore is <hi>Principality</hi> ſaid to be vpon the <hi>shoulder,</hi> becauſe the <hi>keyes</hi> (wherwith it is ſignified) were accuſtomed to be layd vpon the <hi>shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi> Chriſts <hi>Principality</hi> alſo is plainly ſignified by <hi>keyes,</hi>

                     <hi>Theſe things ſayth he that is holy and true, which hath the key of Dauid; which openeth, and no man shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth.</hi> As alſo it is a common cuſtome in politicke gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that when any Citty is yielded to any Prince, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, the <hi>keyes</hi> therof are deliuered withall, in ſigne of their ſubiection. So our Sauiour to ſignify the ample power that he would giue to Peter ouer his Church, promiſed him the keyes of the kingdome of heauen. So many wayes it is proued cleerly, that by the foreſaid words of our Sauiour vnto Peter, he therby promiſed to make him ſupreme head of his Church.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, no reaſon can be alleadged, why ſo ſeuerally it ſhould be ſaid, to Peter, <hi>To thee I will giue the keyes:</hi> and <hi>feed my sheepe,</hi> and that for his ſingular faith and Charity, if therby he had receyued nothing aboue the reſt.</p>

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:252:141"/> the Church being diſperſed all ouer the world. Euen as if the tillage of one or two fields may conueniently be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Care of one husbandman, would it thereupon follow, that the tillage of the fields of the whole world, might commodiouſly be committed to his Charge? This I ſay is impertinent, for the more diſperſed the Church is, the more danger of diſſentions, and thereby the more need of one Paſtour, by whoſe authority Contentions may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: proofe whereof may be the irreconciliable or euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting diſſentions amongſt Proteſtants, by not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging one ſupreme Paſtour.

                  <p>Now, that the ſupreme Paſtour ſucceeding S.

But firſt the wordes of S. Paul are cleere to the contrary, for he ſayth not, <hi>It were good for a man not to touch a woman, or I would giue Counſaile,</hi> (but) <hi>It is good &amp;c.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:252:159"/> and others vnmarryed, that they rather marry then burne, if they perceyue themſelues in frequent temptation thereof; and ſo accordingly he counſaileth that,<note n="(26)" place="margin">

                     <hi>If they do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themſelues, that they marry.</hi> Laſtly, if it be as difficult to liue chaſt, as to liue without meate, in what wicked ſtate liue the fellowes of Colledges in Cambridge and Oxford, and ſundry other Miniſters abroad, who liue not only, the moſt dangerous tyme of their youth vnmarryed, but euen many of them all their liues: Theſe men I thinke liue not without meat, and yet without women, I hope themſelues at leaſt will acknowledge, and not publickly confeſſe the contrary, howſoeuer the caſe truly ſtandeth with them.</p>
                  <p>But the truth is, the foreſayd wordes of S. Paul, <hi>As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning virgins a Commandement of our Lord I haue not, but Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile I giue,</hi> are ſo cleer and vnanſwerable, as that the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtes therupon truly inferring, that a Counſayle is one thing, a Commandement another; D.

                  <p>
                     <hi>S. Chryſoſtome thus explaineth the ſame much more largely:</hi>
                     <note n="(14)" place="margin">Hom. <hi>56.</hi> quae est <hi>8.</hi> de poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia.</note> Do not accuſe our Lord, he doth not Command impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, many do exceed the Commandements themſelues. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they were impoſsible, they would not of their owne accord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them. He no where commandeth virginity, and many keep it, he no where commandeth to poſseſſe no goods, and many giue from themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues their owne ſubstance, the very workes giuing Teſtimony, that there is great facility in the lawes of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandments. They would not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue exceeded them, vnles thoſe things which are commanded were eaſy. He commanded not Virginity, for he that commandeth Virginity, ſubiecteth alſo him that is not willing to the neceſsity of the law, but he that admonisheth, leaueth the hearer Lord of his owne will. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paul ſayd of<note n="(15)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.25.</note> Virgins, I haue no Commandement, but I giue Counſayle. Thou ſeest not a Commandement, but a Counſayle. Thou ſeeſt not a Precept, but an admonition. The one, ſayth he, is of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity, the other of will. I do not command, ſaith he, that I may not burden: I admonish and giue Counſayle, that I may perſuade. <hi>A pure Papiſt was</hi> S. Chryſostome.</p>

Though the word, <hi>Vow,</hi> be not in the New Teſtament, yet the thing it ſelfe, I haue formerly proued from ſeuerall places therof: Vſury is mentioned, and forbidden expreſly in the Old Teſtament, in the New Teſtement it is not expreſly mentioned, and yet is forbidden to Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>But this Peter further vrgeth, that profeſſing our ſelues Chriſtians, we are therby bound to giue our ſelues wholly to Chriſt, and therfore no place is left for vowes. Euen as it were ridiculous for a Child to bynd himſelfe by Bill or Bond to obey his Father; and therfore were the Iſraelites forbidden to vow to God the firſt borne of their cattel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were otherwiſe dew. Anſ. The Iewes were wholly bound to God by reaſon of their Creation and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery from Aegypt, and yet according to Prot. they might lawfully vow. Wherfore true it is, that all we haue, we haue from God, who if he pleaſed might require it from vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and we bound to do what he commandeth; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he leaueth to vs many things free, in which according to our liberty, we may do this or that, therfore many things are both Gods and ours; Gods, becauſe by his guift we haue them; ours, becauſe we may freely diſpoſe them, ſo that it be not againſt God, and of theſe we may therfore vow. And ſo a ſonne may bynd himſelfe to his Father in thoſe thinges, which are in his owne power, of which ſort, is to marry or not to marry: So that if he promiſe to marry, when, and in what ſort his Father commandeth, he is bound to performe it. That of the firſt borne of Cattel, maketh for vs, for the reſt of them might be vowed to God, and yet all are Gods guiftes.</p>

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:252:173"/> that mariage is neceſſary, but only lawfull, and better then fornication; and yet there is a third thing better then them both, to wit, by faſting, praying, and other holy Exerciſes to contayne. As if one ſhould ſay, he that will not fight, let him fly, for it is better to fly, then to be ſlaine; this man doth not forbid fighting, and ouercoming, which is better then either flying, or being ſlaine, but only permitteth flight: So alſo the Apoſtle, when he bad the maryed, who by conſent had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for a tyme, to returne againe togeather, explicateth himſelfe, ſaying, <hi>but I ſay this by Indulgence, not by Commandent.</hi>

Some guiftes of God are giuen to man without his owne cooperation, as health, beauty, prophecy, working of miracles, and the like, and theſe are not in our power, neither can euery man haue them that will, and ſo cannot be vowed.

And as they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue the guift of fayth, who indeed truly belieue, which as we ſee, all do not, according to that,<note n="(18)" place="margin">2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.2.</note>

If we conſider death, ſicknes, and the like, as they are in themſelues, we diſlike and abhorre them; but if we conſider them as matter of patience, the way to heauen, and occaſion to glorify God, we loue and deſire them. Now becauſe this later propenſion only is truly and properly humane, as being according to true iudgment and reaſon, therfore to do againſt this, is ſinne: But ſingle lyfe is only againſt the former propenſion, and agreable with the latter, and therfore there is no offence to do againſt the former.</p>

The meaning therfore is, that it is honourable in all lawfully ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned togeather, whether they be old or yong, noble or baſe, Greekes or Hebrewes &amp;c. And thus is it expounded by<note n="(17)" place="margin">In hunc locum.</note> Theophilact.

                  <p>Laſtly, this place maketh as much agaynſt thoſe who haue the guift of Continency, as againſt Prieſts, ſeeing ſuch, according to Proteſtants, are bound to contayne. But S.

                     <hi>But perhaps it wilbe ſayd, if it be lawfull and good to marry, why it is not lawfull for Priests to haue wyues? To</hi> this he preſently anſwereth, <hi>who knoweth not that euery thing hath its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; for there is ſomething which is not altogeather generally law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to all, and there is ſomething which is lawfull to ſome, and not to others: and which is ſometymes lawfull, and ſometymes not. It is neuer lawfull for any man to commit fornication; but it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to bargayne ſomtymes and ſomtimes not; for before a man be of the Clergy, he may lawfully bargaine, but after not. It is lawfull ſometymes for a Chriſtian to company with his wife, ſometymes not. Vpon dayes of Proceſsion ſometimes it is not lawfull, becauſe abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence must be euen from lawfull things, that what is deſired may more eaſily be obtayned &amp;c. Is euery thing Lawfull before an Emperor, which is lawfull before others? how much more in matters concerning God?

And becauſe he conſidered, that they which had taken their ſleepe with Godlines, had very good Grace layd vp for them. It is therfore a holy and healthfull Cogitation, to pray for the dead, that they may be looſed from their ſinnes.</hi> This place is ſo conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing for Purgatory, and prayer for the dead, that for want of all other anſwere, Prot. preſſed herewith, are forced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelues to that ſhamfull, laſt, and deſperat refuge, of denying the Bookes of Machabees to be Canonicall Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.

                  <p>This alſo may be confirmed by the Example of Dauid, and the whole people of God, and more particularly by the ſingular <hi>ſeauen dayes fast</hi> of the men of Iabes Galaad, for the death of their K. and maiſter Saul.

                  <p>But to come now to the Scriptures of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, which do ſtrongly confirme the ſame: firſt, theſe words of our Sauiour ſeeme very expreſſe,<note n="(7)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.32.</note> 
                     <hi>And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer shall ſpeake a word againſt the ſonne of Man, it shalbe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen him; but he that shall ſpeake against the holy Ghoſt, it shall not be forgiuen him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.</hi> The concluſion hence deduced is, therfore at leaſt ſome other ſinnes may be forgiuen in the world to come; but in Hell there is no remiſſion, ſince out of Hell there is no rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, &amp; in Heauen there needed no remiſſion, ſince none pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſinne can enter thither, therfore a third place muſt be admitted, where thoſe ſinnes may be forgiuen.</p>
                  <p>Some reply that Chriſt compareth heere ſome ſinnes with others, to wit, ſinne againſt the Father and the ſonne, with ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, therfore if he meane, that any ſinnes may be remitted in the world to come, chiefly thoſe which he compareth with the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, but not theſe, ſeeing only veniall ſinnes are there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. But the anſwere is eaſy, for Chriſt ſpeaketh of a full and perfect Remiſſion, including remiſſion both of fault &amp; Puniſhment, and ſo not only veniall, but alſo mortall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:252:192"/> are pardoned in the next world, becauſe the guilt or fault of Mortall ſinne being in this world pardoned, but the puniſhment not alwayes here ſatisfyed, but afterwards diſcharged in Purgatory, the remiſſion therfore euen of mortall ſinnes is there perfected.</p>
                  <p>Others yet would euade by affirming, that of a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth not neceſſarily follow an affirmation, as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (ſay they) king Iohn is not king of the Venetians, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome other is their king: or, finall impenitence ſhall not be forgiuen in this world, nor in hell, therfore ſome ſinnes may be forgiuen in hell. But this forceth nothing, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Rule be not ſo generall, that euery negation doth inforce an affirmation to follow vpon it: yet in our preſent caſe, it muſt needs follow, ſince it were impertinent to ſay, this ſinne ſhall not be forgiuen in this world, nor in the next, if none could be forgiuen in the next; euen as it were impertinent to ſay, King Charles will neither pardon thee in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, nor in Spaine, ſince in Spaine he hath no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to pardon. And therfore as it is well ſaid, king Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les will neither pardon thee in England, nor in Ireland, nor in Scotland, becauſe he hath equall power of pardoning in thoſe places; euen ſo proportionably it is fitly ſaid by our Sauiour, that Blaſphemy againſt the holy Ghoſt, ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be forgiuen in this world, nor in the world to come, partly for that our Sauiour hath equall power to pardon in both places, and partly for that this double Diſtribution of tyme and place, I meane this world and the next, equally belongeth to Gods Iudgment ſeate; and laſtly for that this World, ſignifying a tyme, and Hell a place, are not oppoſite members in the diuiſion vſed by our Sauiour, as this world and the next be. And moſt certaine it is, and granted by all, that by the next world cannot be meant hell, ſince out of Hell there is no redemption, as in hell there is no remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is obiected againſt this place, that whereas S. Matthew ſayth, <hi>neither in this world, nor in the world to come,</hi> S.

Beſids this manner of obiecting, is of ſet purpoſe a willfull miſtaking of the point vrged, for without all Conference or explication falſly by D. Fulke ſuppoſed to be vſed by S. Marke, it is manifeſt of it ſelfe, that he who is not forgiuen neither in this world, not in the world to come, shall neuer be forgiuen; what needeth then any Explication to be added by S.

                  <p>Others reply, that as the other words, <hi>gold, ſiluer, building

                  <p>S. Iohn directeth and limiteth our Prayer for the dead, ſaying,<note n="(34)" place="margin">

                     <hi>He that knoweth his brother to ſinne, a ſinne not to death, let him aske, and lyfe shalbe giuen him, ſinning not to death.

                  <p>Secondly, whereas we are forbidden heer to pray for certayne ſinners, and allowed to pray for certayne others, to wit, for ſuch as ſinne not to death, this place muſt be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood eyther of prayer for the liuing, or for the dead; if of prayer for the dead, then it proueth the thing in queſtion,

                     <hi>If the tree shall fall to the South, or to the North, in what place ſoeuer it shall fall, there shall it be:</hi> therfore there is no Purgatory out of which it may be taken.

Literally this is ſpoken of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall death, that men are neceſſarily to dye, and being dead, they can no more ryſe by themſelues, then the tree that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: But if we will apply this to the Condition of the Soule, then the meaning only is that, in what ſtate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſoeuer, be it of Saluation or Damnation, that a man departeth out of this lyfe, in the ſame State ſhall he euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne, fall the wood to the South, that is, dy the man in ſtate of Saluation, or fall it to the North, that is, dye he in ſtate of damnation: In what place it falleth, there it ſhall be, that is, his Condition ſhall neuer be changed: for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if he depart in grace, ſhall he be able any more to looſe it, neither if he dye out of the ſtate of Grace shall he be euer able hereafter to recouer it, or to rayſe himſelfe vnto it, as the tree being fallen, cannot aryſe vp it ſelfe. Now he who is in Purgatory, is fallen to the South, becauſe he dyed in ſtate of Saluation, and therfore after due purging ſhall goe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Nothing therfore can be inforced out of this place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Purgatory, ſince it belongeth to the South.

                     <hi>For we muſt all be manifested before the Iudgment Seat of Christ, that euery one may receyue the proper thinges of the body, according as he hath done, either good or euill,</hi> by which it may ſeeme that Purgatory is quite taken away.

                     <hi>But the tyme interpoſed bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt mans death, and the last Reſurrection, doth keepe the ſoules in ſecret Receptacles, as euery ſoule is worthy either of eaſe or miſery, according as the ſoule hath wrought liuing in flesh: neither is it to be denyed, that the ſoules of the Dead are relieued with the piety of their liuing friends, when the Sacrifice of the Mediatour is offered for them, or Almes giuen in the Church. But theſe thinges auaile them, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing merited, that theſe thinges might afterwards profit them: for there is a certayne manner of liuing, neither altogeather ſo good; that it may not require theſe helpes after death, nor altogeather ſo bad, that theſe things may not helpe it after death. But ſome kind of liuing is ſo good, that it needeth not theſe helpes, and againe, another ſo euill, that it cannot be holpen with theſe after this lyfe; wherfore here all the merit is to be got, wherby any may be relieued, or payned after this lyfe &amp;c. Theſe things therfore which the Church frequenteth for the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Dead, are not against that ſaying of the Apoſtle, We shall all ſtand &amp;c. Becauſe ech indeed merited this for himſelfe whileſt he liued, that theſe thinges might auayle him, for theſe things do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit all, and why do they not profit all? but for the difference of lyfe which euery one held in flesh, therfore when Sacrifices either of the Aultar, or of what Almes ſoeuer are offered for all the dead baptized; for thoſe who are very good, they are thanks-giuings, for thoſe which are not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry euill they are propitiations, for thoſe which are very euill, although they are no releaſe of ſuch dead, yet are they ſome Conſolations to the liuing.</hi> So far S.

                     </note> partly the ſonnes of God, and partly the ſonnes of the world.</p>
                  <p>A ſixt Obiection is taken from that Promiſe Chriſt made to the Thiefe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted at his death; S. Luke recordeth it thus,<note n="(16)" place="margin">
                        <hi>C.</hi> 25. 43.</note> 
                     <hi>This day thou shalt be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> therfore no Purgatory remayneth, no not for thoſe who haue done no Pennance. The anſwere is: A death ſo cruel, ſuffered ſo patiently, and a Confeſſion of Chriſt ſo admirable, euen then, when the Apoſtles themſelues denied him, might well be taken for a full ſatisfaction: neither do the Priuiledges of a few, make a Law; but beſides, ſeeing the good Thiefe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to dye, deſired our Lord that <hi>he would remember him when he came into his kingdome;</hi> it ſtrongly argueth that the Thiefe thought, that immediatly after death, he was not to go to heauen, otherwiſe he would haue prayed him to haue taken him with him to his kingdome, and yet withall, he hoped not to be damned; wherupon it followeth, that he thought there was ſome other place beſides heauen, and hell, where he was to remayne for a tyme, vntill Chriſt, comming to his kingdome, ſhould remember to take him thence, which was the vttermoſt which the good Thiefe could hope for.</p>
                  <p>Brentius obiecteth, that all are included within theſe words, <hi>Come ye bleſſed &amp;c. and go ye accurſed &amp;c.</hi> Anſwere. The words precedent and ſubſequent, do manifeſtly ſhow, that this is ſpoken of the day of Iudgment, when Purgatory ſhall ceaſe.</p>
                  <p>Some argue thus: In Purgatory a man cannot merit,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:252:201"/> therfore neither ſatisfy. But for anſwere, I may truly ſay that the Conſequence is falſe, for to merit, beſydes Grace is required liberty, and the ſtate of this lyfe, wheras a man may truly ſatisfy, though he be compelled therunto by the Iudge.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly M. Rogers thinketh that,<note n="(17)" place="margin">Def. of the Art art. 11. p. 119.</note> 
                     <hi>In the ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture there is mention but only of two wayes, one leading vnto destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the other bringing vnto lyfe; of two ſortes of men, wherof ſome belieue, and they are ſaued, ſome belieue not, and they are damned: And of two ſtates, one bleſſed, where Lazarus is, the other curſed, where Diues doth abyde.

It is rrue, that wayes, ſtates, and ſortes of men, in regard of Eternity, are but two, but this nothing hindreth but that temporally, and before the day of Iudgment come, there may be more, as hath bene proued formerly from the Scriptures themſelues, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, and ſundry Proteſtant writers.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. II.</hi> It is proued by Scriptures, that the Angels, and Saints in Heauen do know our prayers vpon Earth, and that they pray for vs, and we may lawfully pray vnto them, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſours for vs.</head>
                  <p>SEeing nothing is more frequent in the mouthes of late Sectaries, then that praying to Saints is no where taught in the Seriptures; I will therfore endeauour to proue from thence three points, all neceſſarily belonging to this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, The firſt is, that Angells and Saints do heare our Prayers &amp; know things that are done vpon Earth; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that they pray for vs not only in generall, but alſo in particular. And the third is, that we may lawfully pray to them. The firſt ſhalbe proued from the Prophecy of holy Daniel, where it is ſayd,<note n="(1)" place="margin">
                        <hi>C.</hi> 10.11.</note> 
                     <hi>And he</hi> (to wit the Angell) <hi>ſayd to me, feare not Daniel; Becauſe from the firſt day that thou dideſt ſet thy hart to vnderſtand, to afflict thy ſelfe in the ſight of God, thy words haue been heard, and I am come for thy words.</hi> Now by the words of Daniel, no man doubteth but are vnderſtood his prayers, which were both heard and knowne by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, ſince the Angell giueth the hearing of his prayers to be a cauſe of his comming vnto him. So that Daniel praying vpon Earth, was heard by the Angell in heauen.</p>
                  <p>Secondly this point is proued by theſe wordes of Saint Paul,<note n="(2)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8.9.10.12.</note> 
                     <hi>Whether Prophecyes shalbe made voyd, or tongues shall
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:252:205"/> ceaſe, or knowledge shalbe deſtroyed: for in part we know, and in part we propheſy; but when that shall come that is perfect, that shalbe made voyd, that is in part: we ſee now by a glaſse in a darke ſort; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then I shall know, as alſo I am knowne.</hi> The neceſſary deduction out of this place is this, that the knowledge of the Bleſſed, farre exceedeth any ſupernaturall knowledge, whether of Fayth or Prophecy giuen to man in this lyfe, in ſo much, as what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is knowne by any knowledge of this lyfe, is much more perfectly knowne by that knowledge of the bleſſed. Now it is moſt certaine that many Prophets and holy men vpon Earth, knew the thoughts of other mens harts, and things far diſtant from them, as is made manifeſt by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Eliſeus, when he demanded Giezi<note n="(3)" place="margin">4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 5.26.</note> 
                     <hi>Was not my hart preſent, when the man returned out of his Chariot to meet thee?</hi> Yea he diſcouered vnto him further, all the particulers of his <hi>bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,</hi> togeather with the end, and cauſe which moued him, which muſt needs argue, that he was priuy to his very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward &amp; ſecreteſt thoughts: againe, was not the ſame Prophet priuy to all the ambuſhments that the King of Syria layd to entrap the King of Iſrael? &amp; did he not by Propheticall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, premoniſh the King of Iſrael thereof, ſaying,<note n="(4)" place="margin">4. <hi>Reg.</hi> 6.9. See the like Act. 5.3.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware thou paſse not into ſuch a place, becauſe the Syrians are there in ambushments.</hi> And the King of Iſrael following the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Prophet, preuented him of the ambuſh: and when the King of Syria ſuſpected ſome of his owne to betray his Counſaile vnto the King of Iſrael, did not one of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaylors reply?<note n="(5)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibid. verſ.</hi> 12. And ſee Act 5.1.2. &amp;c. S. Peters knowing the fraudulent dealing of Ananias and Saphira.</note> 
                     <hi>Not ſo my Lord King, but Elizeus the Prophet, which is in Iſrael, telleth the King of Iſrael all words, whatſoeuer thou shalt ſpeake in thy priuy Chamber.</hi> Which point of liuing Prophets knowing mens thoughts and wordes, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo ſecret, and diſtant, was ſo euident, that the very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels themſelues acknowledged it; and yet our Aduerſaries pretending themſelues to be Chriſtian, and Reformers, will not grant this Priuiledge to the Angells, and Saints trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing, and raigning in heauen.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is generally houlden that the damned Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in hell do know things done vpon Earth; and ſhall we
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:252:205"/> deny the like knowledge to the Saintes in heauen? Daneus ſayth,<note n="(6)" place="margin">Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Iſagog. part. 2. c. 33. p. 83.</note> 
                     <hi>The deuils do excell with admirable knowledge of theſe temporall and earthly things.</hi> And experience is ſtrong herein, as appeareth by many Examples, namely of the ſpirit <hi>Orthen</hi> mentioned by Froyzard, and of poſſeſſed children, which in their fits, tell of things done in their abſence: In ſo much as that the Deuils from this their knowledge of things done, did probably coniecture ſuch things to come as were ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon depending, as appeareth by their ſo many Oracles. Yea this point is ſo true, that Aretius<note n="(7)" place="margin">Loc. com. p. <hi>546. 548.</hi>
                     </note> proueth the ſame by ſundry Examples of the Scriptures. Did not Abraham after his death, and yet not in heauen, know that Moyſes &amp; the Prophets were teaching vpon Earth, when he ſaid,<note n="(8)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 16.29.</note> 
                     <hi>They haue Moyſes and the Prophets, let them heare them.</hi> Yea the damned Diues<note n="(9)" place="margin">Ibid. ver. <hi>27.28.</hi>
                     </note> was not ignorant that he had <hi>fyue Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren alyue.</hi> Now then if wicked ſpirits and damned Deuils are not ignorant of things done vpon Earth, ſhall not the bleſſed Angels and glorifyed Saintes, who are nor infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour in knowledge, much the rather vnderſtand &amp; know the ſame?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly this point is proued by thoſe words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour mentioned by S. Luke,<note n="(10)" place="margin">15.10.</note> 
                     <hi>there shall be ioy before the Angels of God vpon one ſinner that doth pennace.</hi> Now none can reioyce, but ſuch as know, what the thing is at which they reioyce: but the Angels reioyce at the conuerſion of a ſinner vpon Earth; therfore it followeth euidently, that they know of the Conuerſion of ſinners vpon earth, that being the cauſe of their Ioy.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly the ſame may be proued from ſuch places as ſhow that we haue Angels to guard vs, as that of S. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,<note n="(11)" place="margin">18.10.</note> 
                     <hi>See that you deſpiſe not one of theſe litles ones, for I ſay to you, that their Angels in heauen, alwayes do ſee the face of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Here amongſt other reaſons, it is vrged, that we ſhould take heed of deſpiſing or ſcandalizing others, becauſe their Angels ſeeing God, ſee the ſame. And when S. Peter<note n="(12)" place="margin">

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:252:206"/> of Angels might be proued from K. Dauid, ſaying,<note n="(13)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſ.</hi> 137.2.</note> 
                     <hi>In the ſight of Angels I will ſing to thee.</hi> And from S. Paul,<note n="(14)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.9.</note> 
                     <hi>we are made a ſpectacle to the world, and to Angels, and to men.</hi> Which Words plainly import that Angels do looke vpon vs.</p>
                  <p>But ſome do reply and ſay, though it be granted, that Angels do know things vpon earth, yet it followeth not that the bleſſed ſoules do the like. But this forceth nothing: for firſt, that granted to Angels that they know things vpon Earth, then it euidently followeth, that they knowing our neceſſities, do in their Charity pray for vs, and that we may lawfully pray to them. Secondly of Saintes it is ſaid, that<note n="(15)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.30.</note> 
                     <hi>they are as heauenly Angels,</hi> and in another place,<note n="(16)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Luc.</hi> 20.36.</note> 
                     <hi>equall to Angels,</hi> and yet in a third place, there is ſaid to be in heauen,<note n="(17)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.17.</note> 
                     <hi>The meaſare of a man, which is of an Angell.</hi> All which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth, that the Saintes in heauen may enioy equall glory with the Angels. Beſides they are indued with their vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, glorifyed, and eleuated with the light of glory, &amp; with the preſence and true ſight of God, as the Angels are, and therfore nothing is wanting to them herein, which is granted to the Angels. And they haue this more then An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, that they are members of the body of the Church, more conioyned with vs, then the Angels, and haue experienced our miſeries and dangers.</p>
                  <p>Caluin confeſſeth this argument to conuince, if we can proue, that as the Angels haue charge of men, and do guard them, &amp; are preſent at their affayres, ſo the bleſſed ſoules of men do the like.

                  <p>¶ Now followeth the ſecond part of this Section, viz. That Angells &amp; Saints pray for vs. And firſt we read in the Prophet Zachary, that the Angell prayed for the people,<note n="(26)" place="margin">
                        <hi>C.</hi> 1.12.</note> 
                     <hi>And the Angell of our Lord anſwered and ſayd: O Lord of Hoſtes how long wilt thou not haue mercy on Hieruſalem, and on the Citties of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, with which thou hast beene angry? This is now the</hi> 70. <hi>yeare.</hi> Heere the Angell prayeth in particular for Hieruſalem, and the Citties of Iuda.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we read in the Booke of Tobias, that the Angell Raphaell ſayd to Tobias,<note n="(27)" place="margin">
                        <hi>C.</hi> 12.12.</note>

                     <hi>I am Raphael an Angell one of the ſeauen which aſsiſt before our Lord.</hi> This place is ſo plaine for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of Angells, that in want of better anſwere, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker ſayth,<note n="(29)" place="margin">Ad rat.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Little do we regard the example of Raphael the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell mentioned in Toby, neither do we acknowledge thoſe ſeauen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:252:207"/> whereof he ſpeaketh: all this is different from the Canonicall Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and ſauoureth I know not of what ſuperſtition.</hi> But it ſeemeth Whitaker did not well remember, that mention is made of thoſe 7. Angels, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 1.4. and 5.6. And that the booke of Toby is Canonicall Scripture, I haue proued before.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is recorded in the 2. booke of<note n="(30)" place="margin">15.12.14.</note> Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hees, how <hi>Iudas Machabeus ſaw in viſion Onias ſtretching forth his hands, praying for all the people of the Iewes; &amp; that Onias ſaid of Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy, This is a louer of his brethren, who prayeth much for the people, &amp; for al the holy Citty.</hi> To this Whitaker only anſwereth,<note n="(31)" place="margin">Ad rat.

                     <hi>I let paſſe that dreame of Iudas concerning Onias, whereof we read</hi> 2. <hi>Mach.</hi> 15. <hi>But it litle skilleth whether thou vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d interceſsion of the dead, or Sacrifice: both is falſe.</hi> So that no other anſwere is left to theſe places, but only the deniall of the ſaid bookes to be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Scripture, wheras the contrary is already proued at large.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Almighty God ſayd vnto Hieremy,<note n="(32)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Cap.</hi> 15.1.</note> 
                     <hi>If Moyſes and Samuell shall stand before me, my ſoule is not towards this people;</hi> which argueth, that they were wont to ſtand before God, praying for others. Caluin anſwereth, that from this place rather the contrary is to be gathered, for ſeeing it is ſaid, if they ſhall ſtand, to wit, to pray, it importeth that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtood, nor prayed. But though peraduenture it be ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, that as then they did not pray, becauſe they vnderſtood the matter then to be deſperate, yet it is ſignifyed that at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times they were accuſtomed to pray, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they thought they might obtayne: for otherwiſe Gods ſpeach had not beene apt &amp; congruous. For if a man ſhould ſay, If my horſe ſhould pray for thee, I will not graunt it, he ſhould ſpeake fooliſh, becauſe horſes cannot pray: and in like ſort, if one ſhould ſay, if Demoſthenes ſhall come, he ſhall not perſuade me, this ſpeach alſo were fooliſh, becauſe dead men do not vſe to come. And the ſame, which God forbid, might be ſayd of thoſe words, <hi>If Moyſes and Samuel shall stand before me,</hi> if they neyther could, nor were accuſtomed to pray. And it is to be noted, that it is not ſayd, <hi>If they should stand,</hi> that is, if by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility they ſhould now liue and pray, but, <hi>if they ſhall ſtand,</hi> which ſignifyeth what they might do, to wit, pray.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, S. Iohn relateth that,<note n="(33)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5.8.</note> 
                     <hi>The</hi> 24. <hi>Elders feldown

                  <p>Sixtly, the Martyrs in heauen cry with a loud voyce, ſaying,<note n="(34)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6.10.</note> 
                     <hi>How long Lord, holy and true, iudgeſt thou not, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengest not our blood of them that dwell vpon the Earth?</hi> Now if they pray for reuenge of their enemies, much more for mercy and grace for their friends.

                     <hi>In the Apocalyps</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the ſoules of the Saints ſlayne, do cry out that their blood may be reuenged, not that now resting in the Lord, they are deſirous of reuenge, according to the manner of men, but that the Lord euen after their death, is myndfull of the prayers, which whilest they liued vpon Earth, they powred out for the deliuery of themſelues and the whole Church.</hi> But this is directly contrary to the words of the Text, which affirme, that they then in heauen did actually pray for reuenge. Beſydes, it is falſe and iniurious to Martyrs, to ſay, that whileſt they were liuing, they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red reuenge of their Perſecutors, for they rather with Chriſt our Sauiour, and S. Steuen, prayed for their pardon: whileſt they were liuing, they were ſubiect to ſinne, and ſo might haue bene in danger if they had asked reuenge, to haue done it vpon anger, hatred, and malice: Wheras now in heauen, according to S. Bedes expoſition, they do it in regard, and loue of Iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>S. Peter promiſeth to pray for his flock after his death, ſaying,<note n="(36)" place="margin">2. <hi>Ep. c.</hi> 1.13.14.15.</note>

                  <p>D.

                  <p>Hauing thus declared already, that the Angels and Saintes know and heare our prayers, and further that they pray for vs; becauſe D. Fulke thinketh that,<note n="(45)" place="margin">Againſt Rhem. Teſt. in 2 Pet. 1.15. p. 443.</note> 
                     <hi>if it were proued, that the Saintes departed do pray for vs, yet haue we no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant out of Scriptures to pray to them:</hi> I will now in the reſidue of this Section, endeauour to proue from the Scriptures, that we may lawfully pray to them; which indeed neceſſarily followeth by force of Argument drawne from the premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, thus.

                  <p>But this is proued further by warrant of Scripture &amp; manyfold examples therin contained: for fitſt the Patriarch Iacob coming to bleſſe the children of his ſonne Ioſeph, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim, and Manaſſes, inuocated the Angell thus,<note n="(46)" place="margin">

                  <p>Caluins reply to this place is, that God is not heere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocated by the merits of his Saints, nor elſwhere, but onely that there is a rehearſall made of the Couenant, which God made with the Patriarches, concerning the helping &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting of their poſterity.

And as for the words of Iob, they only proue that naturally the dead do not know the deeds of the liuing; &amp; the very ſelfeſame thing proueth the place following of Eccleſiaſtes: but what maketh this againſt ſuch as are enlightned ſupernaturally with the preſence of God, hauing their vnderſtandings to that end eleuated with the light of glory, or els that come to know of thinges paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing heer by ſupernaturall meanes.

                  <p>In concluſion, for full ſatisfaction of theſe obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, let S.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Therefore we must confeſse, that the dead indeed do not know what is done here, but whilest any thing is here done, that afterward truly they heare of them, who go hence to them by dying: not all things verily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſuch things as they are ſuffered to declare, who are ſuffered both to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber theſe things, as alſo ſuch things as is meete for them to heare, to whom they relate theſe things. Moreouer the dead may heare of the Angels who are preſent to things done here ſomthing, which he, to whom all things are ſubiect, iudgeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uement for euery one of them to heare: for vnleſse there were Angels, who might be preſent at the places both of the liuing and dead, our Lord Ieſus had neuer ſaid, It happened alſo that the poore man dyed, and was caryed by Angels into Abrahams bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Now therfore heere, now there may they haue bene, who haue taken hence thither thoſe whom God would. Moreouer the ſpirits of the dead may know ſomethings done here by the ſpirit of God reuey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which it is neceſſary that they should know, and not neceſſary that they should be ignorant of not only things paſt or preſent, but alſo things to come: as not all men, but Prophets did know, whileſt they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued here; neither did they know all things but ſuch things as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God did iudge meete to be reueyled vnto them.</hi> Hitherto
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:252:216"/> S. Auſtine. The ſumme of all is but this, that Saintes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted know things done here three manner of wayes, to wit, by Saintes hence departing to them, by Angels decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and Gods holy ſpirit reueyling: and this may ſuffice for a full anſwere to all places brought in this ſecond obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>The third Obiection is taken out of that place of S. Paul to Timothy,<note n="(16)" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.</note> 
                     <hi>For there is one God, one alſo Mediator of God and men, Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> therfore we muſt not make any Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes our Mediatours. To make this the ſtronger, the Prot. of Geneua in their Bible of Anno 1601. by Mathew Berion, do adde the word, <hi>ſolus,</hi> one only Mediatour. Anſwere The word, <hi>ſolus,</hi> is neither in the Greeke, nor the vulgar latine, nor in thoſe of Beza of 1589. 1590. nor others of Geneua of 1555. 1563. 1564. 1570. and ſo the place is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly corrupted. Secondly, this maketh as much againſt the prayers of the liuing for vs, as of the dead: for when we deſire our Neighbour to pray for vs, therein we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire him to be our mediatour, in the ſame manner as we deſire the Saints.

                  <p>The firſt thing therfore in queſtion is, whether it be lawfull to make the Image of God himſelfe, or of the B. Trinity? To which I anſwere, that though the ſame be not ſo certaine a matter of faith, as the other of the making of the Images of Chriſt and his Saintes is, yet the lawfulnes therof may ſundry wayes be proued.

And I verily thinke, that when due reuerence is giuen by hat and knee at the hearing of our Kings name, when it is read in Proclamations, or otherwiſe, not one Caluiniſt in England durſt cenſure the Kings name, for a word ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall, in regard of the honour done vnto it.

                  <p>Fourthly, the Images of Kings may be worſhipped with Ciuil honour, therefore the Images of Chriſt and his Saints with Religious honour, the things repreſented being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, as the other are ciuil. And whereas the<note n="(52)" place="margin">

                  <p>Further, an Image is capable of iniury<note n="(53)" place="margin">Euſeb. hist. l. <hi>9.</hi> c. <hi>10.</hi> Chryſoſt. hom. <hi>2.</hi> &amp; <hi>3.</hi> ad po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochenum.

Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisb. parte al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera Praef. p. <hi>12</hi> poſt med.</note> 
                     <hi>That the ſecond Commandement of the first Table concerning Images, pertayned only to the Iewes, as being part of the Ceremoniall Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vpon all theſe Premiſes the Concluſion is. 1. That ſince by the Proteſtantes confeſſion, the Image of Chriſt may be made: 2. ſince likewiſe for the direction of our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, the Image of Chriſt is the ſame to our eye, that the ſound or name of Ieſus is to our eare: 3. ſince alſo, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious kind of reuerence is to be exhibited at the name of Ieſus, and as M. Iewell and Hoſpinian haue affirmed, to Sacramentes, and to all other like things in ſuch religious wiſe to Chriſt belonging: ſince as M. Iewell<note n="(79)" place="margin">In his Reply. p. 409.</note> and Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinian<note n="(80)" place="margin">In Hiſt. Sacram. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>8.</hi> p. <hi>477.</hi>
                     </note> further ſay as before, and the other premiſſes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, the forſaid honour reſteth not in them, but is ſafely without all danger of Idolatry, or diſhonour paſſed ouer from them to the thinges ſignifyed; that therfore the Image of Chriſt and of his Saintes, as they may be lawfully made,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:252:226"/> ſo alſo vpon the forſaid ground they may be ſafely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. The concluſion of all which is no other, but that Chriſt and his Saintes may be worſhiped in their pictures, no leſſe then Chriſt is in his name and Sacraments, and no leſſe then an Earthly King is in his Image, or Cloath of Eſtate. As for the forſaid Commandement, it is cleere by the premiſſes, that therby is only forbidden, not ſuch forſaid worſhip, as not being of its owne nature diſhonourable, ſhould then firſt become vnlawfull by force of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, but ſuch worſhip as was then before of it owne nature vnlawfull, in reguard wherof that Commandement was publiſhed: this, as appeareth by the premiſſes, was then only Idolatry, which became not euill becauſe it was then prohibited, but then was prohibited, becauſe it was before that, euill.</p>

Thirdly, a thing may be painted without a hiſtory, to expreſſe the nature of the thing, not by any immediate or proper ſimilitude as it is in it ſelfe, but by Analogy, or metaphoricall and myſticall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification; and ſo we paint Angels as young men, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, bare-footed, hauing winges, therby to expreſſe their ſtrength, agility, &amp; glory: and both theſe wayes may God &amp; Angels be painted.</p>

Againe men are no where commanded to ſeeke for their cure by miracle, but in this place of Iames is a commandement ſignified; alſo the guift of Miraculous cure was not common<note n="(70)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9 10.27.28.</note> to all Prieſtes or Elders, but to ſome only; wheras here the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is indefinite, referred indifferently to them all.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, S. Iames ſpeaketh not of curing the party, but of eaſing, or lifting him vp in ſoule. And if this place of S. Iames had concerned a miraculous cure, which the ſicke perſon had bene commanded to ſeeke for, and promiſed to obtayne (as the thing here intended is commanded to be ſought for, and promiſed to be giuen,) who then would in thoſe tymes haue dyed, when he might haue obtained his cure by miracle, and bene commanded ſo to do? And laſtly to
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:252:252"/> omit many other differences, this conferreth Remiſſion of ſinnes, which a miraculous cure did not. And hereunto may be added, that the Catholicke Church throughout the world, obſerueth this practiſe of Extreme Vnction, not as inuented by men, but affirmed by Fathers and Proteſtants, and vſed in all ages without any firſt Inſtitution therof no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, other then that which was in the Apoſtles time.

                     <hi>Theſe are the Demonſtrations, theſe the foundations, wherewith the number of</hi> 7. <hi>Sacraments was brought into the Church, and receyued by Scholasticall writers:</hi> And that in the Old Law there were vertues and ſinnes, and a ſpirituall and corporall lyfe, and therefore by the lyke reaſon they ſhould haue 7. Sacraments. As alſo, that in the Scriptures there are ſeueral numbers renowned and ſacred, as 3. 12. &amp;c. And therefore, that hence we may aſwell proue that there are 3. 12. or more Sacraments.

So alſo the Congruence from Numbers, is not taken from all numbers whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, but from ſuch as ſignify Expiation or Satisfaction for ſinne. Now, the number of 7. in Expiations, is ſo frequent in Scriptures, as that the whole Scripture may be thought

If reply be made, that for <hi>Trinity, and Vnity,</hi> and for Baptiſme, and the Euchariſt, the ſubſtance of the things themſelues are expreſſed in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, therefore theſe are to be admitted; I grant the whole, and conſequenly likewiſe inferre vpon the ſame ground, that as for the things required to make the other 5.

In like ſort though the Scriptures do not in expreſſe wordes ſay, there are 7.

                     <hi>We ſay it is done ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, not that we may counterfayt an Imagination &amp;c. but rather becauſe this miſtery of our vnion with Chriſt is ſo high a thing, that it ſurmonteth all our ſenſes, yea and the whole Order of nature; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it being diuine and heauenly, cannot be perceiued, nor apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but by faith.</hi> Secondly, the Confeſſion of Belgia ſayth,<note n="(14)" place="margin">In Harm.

                  <p>But this Doctrine and manner of the Prot.

After what manner, at the laſt shall this be done, demanded the holy Virgin; becauſe I know not men? The Archangell Gabriel anſwered, The holy Ghost shall come v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thee, and the power of the highest shall ouershadow thee. Thou alſo now demaundeſt, how bread and wyne mixt with water, is made the Body and bloud of Christ? And I in like manner anſwere thee: the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit commeth vpon, and maketh them; which thinges ſo made, exceed all ability of ſpeech and vnderſtanding of the mynd. Moreouer bread and wyne are therfore vſed, becauſe humane imbecility is well knowne and manifested to God; becauſe for the most part it is auerſe, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure but thinges common by Cuſtome. Hence it commeth to paſſe, that God for his accuſtomed Indulgence towards vs, worketh thoſe thinges which ſurmount nature by things vſuall &amp; familiar to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And euen as he hath therfore coupled the Grace of the holy Ghoſt in Baptiſme with oyle &amp; water, &amp; hath made it the Lauer of regeneration, becauſe it is vſuall amongst men to be washed with water, and annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with oyle: in the ſame manner, becauſe the vſe and cuſtome of men, doth ſo beare it that men eate bread, and drinke wyne and water, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath ioyned his diuinity with theſe, and hath made them his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and his Bloud, that by things vſuall and agreable to nature, we may aryſe to ſupernaturall things. Doubtles the body truly vnited to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, is that body which was borne of the holy Virgin, not that, that Body was aſſumed of the heauen and deſcended, but becauſe the very Bread and wyne are changed into the Body and bloud of God. But if thou require how it be done, let it ſuffice thee to heare, that it is done by the holy Ghost, as our Lord alſo framed to himſelfe, and in himſelfe flesh of the holy Mother of God by the holy Ghost.

                  <p>THe Textes of ſacred Scripture being ſo confeſſedly cleere for the <hi>Reall Preſence</hi> as hath bene ſhewed, let vs now ſee what poore Obiections they make againſt it. Some obiect, that what our Sauiour tooke into his handes, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and brake, that he gaue to his Diſciples: but he tooke, bleſſed and brake bread; therfore it was but Bread which he gaue to his Diſciples. Anſw. It was not the ſame which our Sauiour tooke, and which he gaue, for he tooke common bread, but by his bleſſing and power of his word, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the ſame into his Body, and ſo gaue it to them, and ſo betwixt <hi>tooke</hi> and <hi>gaue,</hi> paſſeth the word, <hi>bleſſed,</hi> which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that all the verbes gouern not the ſame accuſatiue caſe in the ſame manner: as if one ſhould ſay, a certaine man ſtruck Peter, ſlew him, and buried him, he doth not meane that he buryed him aliue, though he ſtroke him aliue. Yea Prot. themſelues are inforced to anſwere this Argument, for
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:252:291"/> they teach, that our Sauiour taking common and ordinary bread, made it Sacramentall: ſo that it was not the ſame thing which he tooke and gaue.</p>
                  <p>Secondly it is obiected, that the word <hi>(is)</hi> is oftentimes taken in Scripture for <hi>(ſignify,)</hi> therfore in the Sacrament there is not Chriſtes Body, but Bread a ſigne therof. Anſw. Though this hath bene ſufficiently<note n="(1)" place="margin">See be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. ſect. 5.</note> anſwered before, yet I add, that the word <hi>(is)</hi> is more often taken for its owne ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnification.

Whitaker diſcourſeth at large, endeauouring to proue the Reall Preſence, to be a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and therfore impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>For our better proceeding and eaſier diſſoluing of all theſe falſly pretended difficulties &amp; contradictions, faigned and deuiſed only by the Aduerſaries of the Reall Preſence, we affirme firſt, that according to Rules of Logicke (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which only, a Contradiction muſt be examined) a Contradiction doth conſiſt of two Propoſitions, or ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, wherof the one is an affirmatiue, the other a negatiue, or deniall of that which is affirmed; as for example to ſay, that Chriſts Body is preſent in this place, and Chriſts Body is not preſent in this place, theſe two ſayings are contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and being taken <hi>(ſecundum idem)</hi> that is, in one and the ſame reſpect, they cannot by any poſſibility be both of them true. Or ſecondly a Contradiction is that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand with the eſſence of the things, as to ſay, that one
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:252:294"/> and the ſame tyme, and other like Circumſtances, is, and is not. But the Preſence of Chriſtes Body in this place, and that place, yea in a million of places at one tyme, is not of this kind, for it denieth not the being of his Body in either place, but only affirmeth the Preſence therof in all places where it is. Neither is it againſt the eſſence of Chriſtes Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or deſtroyeth the nature of Chriſtes Body, to be in the Sacrament, and in as many places, as that ſacred and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate hoſt is offered vp. For better illuſtration wherof, I will giue ſome like reſemblances: firſt in the myſtery of the B. Trinity, do we not belieue, that one and the ſelfeſame ſubſtance, and diuine Eſſence in number to be at once and for euer in three ſeuerall and diſtinct perſons? A matter no leſſe wonderfull, then the manifold Preſence of Chriſtes Body in many places: for as there is in the Sacrament a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of places, ſo in this Miſtery of the Trinity a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of perſons; and therfore, as there is in this a moſt ſimple vnity, of nature or eſſence, notwithſtanding the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of perſons, ſo in the other alſo without all danger of Contradiction, there may be a like vnity of Body, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the aforeſaid diſtinction of places. And here the Arrians might, and did aſwell cauill about this Miſtery of the Trinity, as the Proteſtantes do now about the Reall Preſence.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond reſemblance of this Miſtery, may be giuen in the ſoule of Man: this ſoule not being proportionable to the extenſion of the Body, (for ſo it were materiall depending of the Body, and mortall with it) but an indiuiſible vnity and immortall, is notwithſtanding, as both Philoſophy and Truth teacheth, wholy in the whole Body, and wholy in euery part therof; and we may eaſily imagine, that God by his power is able to conſerue it at once in ſeuerall members cut of, and deuided from the ſaid Body, euen as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the ſame members, when they were vnited to the Body.</p>
                  <p>This difficulty may alſo be better conceiued, though not proued, by example of one and the ſame word, the which being once vttered, is therupon at one and the ſame
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:252:294"/> inſtant in the hearing of ſundry perſons, and not as a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and indiſtinct noyſe multiplied in the ayre, but as one peculiar word diſtinguiſhed with the ſame ſyllables, wherin it was vttered. As alſo one Seale doth impart to ſundry peeces of waxe, one and the ſame Print or forme; and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry looking glaſſes can in like manner containe in them at one tyme, euen one and the ſame fauour or reſemblance.</p>

Much more may we meruayle, how the Carnall eyes, and eares of Paul could reach from Earth to heauen: and if this perforce they muſt attribute to the power of God (which though it did not happen, yet to be poſſible we grant) with farre leſſe reaſon can they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny through the ſame power, the like priuiledge to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifyed ſoules.</p>

                  <p>But againſt this ſome further vrge, that Chriſtes Body as it is vpon the Aultar is not continuated with it ſelfe, as it is in heauen, for many other Bodies are betwixt; therefore it is deuided, and ſo not one. To this, I anſwere, in that Caſe it is neither continuated, nor diſcontinuated or deuided, for this doth properly belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g to things which be many, whether they the wholes or parts. And therefore though many Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies be betwixt Chriſts Body, as it is in heauen and vpon the Aultar, yet this proueth not that Chriſtes Body is deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in reſpect of it ſelfe, but only in reſpect of the place, to wit, that heauen and Earth are diſcontinuated.</p>
                  <p>It is vrged againe, if a Body can be in two places at one tyme, then at the ſame tyme it may be remote &amp; neere, come to, and go from the ſaid place; in one place be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hoat, and in another place extreme cold, in one place be wounded and ſlayne, and in another be ſafe and aliue, or the like, all which imply. Anſw. Such reſpects are multiplied as follow the places, not others: ſo in the forſayd caſe it might be aboue and below, neere and
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:252:296"/> remote, moue and reſt &amp;c. none of which do repugne, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are in diuers reſpects, to wit, in reguard of diuers places: euen as the ſoule of man, which as it is in the head and feete, is remote, and not remote from the Earth; &amp; one hand mouing, the other reſting, the ſoule at the ſame tyme is ſayd to moue and reſt. Now ſuch actions and qualities as do not agree to the Body in reguard of the place, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of it ſelfe, and ſo are receiued and inherent in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it ſelfe, are not multiplied, no more then the Body it ſelfe: So a Body hoat in one place, is alſo hoat in another; and if extreme heate ſhould be applyed in one place, and extreme cold in another, it ſhould be in the ſame ſtate, as if the ſayd Contraries were applyed to a body in one place, that is, neither extreme hoat, nor extreme cold: and ſo if a man ſhould be hungry, wounded, ſlaine &amp;c. in one place, the like he ſhould be in another. Add laſtly what Melancthon ſaith heereof in generall,<note n="(30)" place="margin">Ep. ad Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Gereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</note> 
                     <hi>I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye, then affirme this which the Zwinglians affirme, that Christs Body cannot be but in one place. Therefore conſtantly reproue them publickly and priuatly when occaſion shalbe.</hi> And this may ſuffice for anſwere to the firſt ſuppoſed Contradiction of Chriſtes Body being in diuers places.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſuppoſed Contradiction is, that it doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, for Chriſtes Body to be contained within ſo ſmall a compaſſe, as is the Sacramentall hoſt. But to this I anſwer, as it is not eſſentiall to a Body to occupy a place, ſo neither is it eſſentiall, that the greatnes of the place muſt portio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably anſwere the greatnes of the Body: for neyther place, nor anſwerable greatnes of place to the body, is put in the definition of a Body, which they ſhould be, if they were eſſentiall to a Body; and the higheſt heauen hath exceeding great magnitude, and yet is without all place.</p>

<pb n="533" facs="tcp:252:299"/> not periſh with it, for then he that lacked his arme ſhould looſe his ſoule; neyther doth it hang in the ayre, becauſe the ayre is not organized to receiue the information, but ceaſing to informe the member cut off, it doth without any motion to place, only looſe that ſubiect and place, keeping ſtill the place and reſidence in the Body where it was before: euen ſo the Body of Chriſt, when the formes of Bread and wine are corrupted in the ſtomake, doth without any motion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place to place only become abſent, or leaueth that aboad, which it had in the ſtomake, and keepeth the place which then, and before it had in heauen.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond I anſwere, that as the Diuinity filleth all places how vndecent and vncleane ſoeuer; the Sunne bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes alſo beating vpon a dunghill, and not defyled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; ſo Chriſts Body being immortall &amp; impaſſible, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be defyled with the touch or impreſſion of any infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or vncleane Creature.

And as it was not vndecent, but a ſigne of great mercy and loue, that he ſhould ſuffer that; ſo it is not more vnſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely, that his Body ſhould admit the other, ſeeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſuffereth nothing, but only his remaining there to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify and worke admirable effectes of loue and Grace.</p>

                  <p>THe proofe of the firſt point, of Chriſt being whole in eyther kind, is drawne from three Principles of fayth: firſt that by reaſon of thoſe words of Chriſt, This is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which ſhalbe giuen for you, that in the Euchariſt is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; really the very body of Chriſt. The ſecond, that Chriſt our Sauiour after his Reſurrection from death was neuer to dye agayne according to thoſe wordes of S. Paul,<note n="(1)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi>

                        </gap>.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Christ riſing agayne from the dead, now dyeth no more, Death shall no more haue Dominion ouer him:</hi> whence it neceſſarily followeth, that vnder the forme of Bread is not the Body of Chriſt without Bloud and Soule, for ſo it ſhould be without life, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently dead. The third, that Chriſt is one diuine perſon ſubſiſting in two natures, from whence it immediatly ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that ſince the Body of Chriſt hath no other ſubſiſtence then that of his Godhead, which really is all one with his Eſſence, that therefore whereſoeuer his Body is, there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his Diuinity. This argument ſuppoſing theſe 3. principles doth euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly conuince; &amp; for the two later I doubt not but moſt Prot. will admit; and the firſt is acknowledged for true by all Lutherans, and hath beene already proued.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the ſame is proued by thoſe words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,<note n="(2)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Io.</hi> 6.57.</note> 
                     <hi>He that eateth me, the ſame alſo shall liue by me.</hi> Now, Chriſt is not eaten but vnder the forme of Bread, therefore vnder that forme is not only his ſacred Body, but his bleſſed Soule, and precious Bloud, euen whole Chriſt: for of his Body only he would neuer haue ſayd, <hi>he that eateth me;</hi> and <hi>I am the bread of lyfe which deſcended from heauen;</hi> And againe, <hi>This is the Bread which deſcended from heauen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the ſecond point, viz. that the true Eſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce of the Sacrament is found in eyther kind, it is proued; for in
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:252:304"/> a Sacrament is only required that it be a ſigne and cauſe of Grace. The ſigne in the Euchariſt, as it is a Sacrament, is twofold: the firſt of internall refection, according to thoſe wordes of Chriſt,<note n="(3)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Io.</hi> 6.55.</note>

                     <hi>for being many we are one Bread, one Body, all that participate of one Bread.</hi> Now, both theſe ſignifications are found in eyther kind; for firſt, ſpirituall refection only importeth the refection of the ſoule, which whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her it be by way of meate or drinke, or both im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth not, ſeeing in ſpirituall refections, one and the ſelfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame thing is ſayd to be meate and drinke. For example, of of Iuſtice our Sauiour ſayth,<note n="(5)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6.</note> 
                     <hi>Bleſſed are they who hunger &amp; thirst Iustice, for they shalbe filled.</hi> Likewiſe of wiſdome the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeman ſayth,<note n="(6)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 24.29.</note> 
                     <hi>They that eate me shall yet hunger, and they that drinke me shall yet thirst:</hi> Wherefore as our Sauiour ſayd, <hi>my flesh is truly meate and my Bloud is truly drinke,</hi> ſo alſo in the ſame place he ſayd, <hi>he that eateth this Bread shall liue for euer.</hi> And, <hi>he that eateth me shall liue by me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the ſecond ſignification of the Vnion of the faythfull among themſelues, it is expreſſed by many graynes of Corne wrought togeather, by making Bread thereof with flower and water, as S.<note n="(7)" place="margin">L. <hi>2.</hi> Ep, <hi>3.</hi> ad Caecil.</note> Cyprian teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the like may be ſhewed of the wine compoſed of many grapes, and mingled with water in the Chalice. And as for the cauſe of Grace requiſite in a Sacrament, it is found in eyther kind, for it is Chriſt, Cauſe and Authour of all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and of Grace thereby giuen, who vnder eyther forme is whole &amp; entire, as hath beene before proued. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it heerupon follow, that becauſe the Sacrament is Eſſentially contayned vnder eyther kind, that therefore the Prieſt receiuing vnder both, receyueth two Sacramentes, for being receyued both at once they make but one, as being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned to one refection, ſignifying one thing, and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing one eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ct: euen as ſixe or ſeauen diſhes of meat ſet vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Table, do but make one dinner, whereas part thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ſerued one day, and the reſt another, they would make two. And the reaſon why Prieſts receiue vnder both kinds, is becauſe they offer vp a Sacrifice, which repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:252:305"/> the Sacrifice of Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, which were not perfectly repreſented but by both kinds, for the only forme of Bread would not repreſent Chriſt, as dead, without ſome ſigne of bloud, nor the only forme of wyne would ſufficiently repreſent him as ſacrificed, ſeeing only wyne is not an hoſt, or thing to be ſacrificed: wherefore alſo in this ſort was it prefigured in the Sacrifice of Melchiſedech, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp both Bread and wyne.</p>
                  <p>Hauing thus proued the Premiſſes, viz. That whole Chriſt is contained vnder eyther kind, and the true eſſence of the Sacrament: from hence it directly followeth, that neither irreuerence is offered to the Sacrament, it not being (as is obiected) giuen halfe or maymed, but eſſentially whole; nor iniury to the people by depriuing them of any Grace neceſſary to Saluation, ſeeing the very fountayne of Grace is no leſſe receiued vnder eyther kind, then vnder both.</p>
                  <p>By theſe premiſſes it is euident, that if we reſpect the nature of the thing, no obligation or neceſſity a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yſeth of receiuing both kinds: the only queſtion therefore remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, Whether therto we be bound by any Precept of Chriſt, whereof I will treat in the next Section.</p>

                  <p>But Luther further argueth, that to whome it is ſayd, <hi>eate,</hi> to them it is ſayd, <hi>drinke;</hi> wherefore the whole Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is eyther to be giuen only to Prieſts, or alſo to the Laity; if alſo to theſe, then to all it is ſayd, <hi>eate and drinke;</hi> if only to Prieſts, then it is not lawfull differently from the Inſtitution of Chriſt to giue any part thereof to the Laity, and of this Argument he thus inſulteth, <hi>I confeſſe my ſelfe to be ouercome with this vnanſwerable reaſon, neyther haue I read, heard, or found what to ſay agaynst it.</hi> But that you may ſee the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Luther ſo eaſily ouercome, and how ſmall and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall his reading, hearing, and fynding hath beene; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: Admitting, that to the ſame was ſayd, <hi>eate,</hi> to whome <hi>drinke,</hi> viz. to the Apoſtles; as alſo I graunt that the whole Sacrament is to be giuen not only to Prieſts, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the Laity; but that which is inferred heereof is moſt falſe, to wit, that if the whole Sacrament be to be giuen to

                  <p>But yet not ſatisfyed, he further replyeth, that ſeeing Chriſt ſaid, <hi>This is my Bloud which shalbe shed for you, and for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> that therfore it is to be giuen to all for whom it was ſhed, in which number no doubt the Laity is contayned, &amp; of this reaſon he thus triumpheth, <hi>This of all chiefly vrgeth, and altogeather concludeth me:</hi> and ſo it may indeed for a ſingular aſſe; for if the Bloud were to be giuen to all for whom it was ſhed, then were it to be giuen to Iewes, Turkes, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Infants, and moſt abhominable ſinners, for all whom no doubt Chriſt ſpent his moſt precious Bloud; Wherfore the words obiected only conclude, (and that moſt manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly againſt Prot.) that in the Chalice was truly Bloud, ſeeing Chriſt ſaid therof, <hi>This is my bloud which shalbe shed for you, and for many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly ſome reply, that though it be true, that Chriſt ſpake vnto his Apoſtles when he ſaid, <hi>Drinke yee all of this,</hi> yet the Apoſtles as then repreſenting all the faithfull, all the faithfull did therfore drinke in them, and therfore now are to do it in themſelues. But this auayleth not, for beſides, that it is only but imagined and not proued, that all the faithfull were as then repreſented in the Apoſtles, yet ſuppoſing it
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:252:313"/> were ſo, thence might we gather that now they are not bound to the Chalice, ſeeing that Precept they haue already either fulfilled in the Apoſtles, or at the leaſt, that ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they fulfill the ſame in Prieſtes, who drinke of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and whome the Apoſtles as then did indeed truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent.</p>
                  <p>The third<note n="(30)" place="margin">Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Def. of the Art. art. 30. p. 180.</note> principall Obiection is taken from the firſt Inſtitution of this Sacrament, which was by Chriſt our Sauiour vnder both, and vnder the ſaid both kinds giuen to the preſent Communicants the 12. Apoſtles; Wherfore to Communicate vnder one kind ſeemeth to alter the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, and therfore is vnlawfull. The weaknes of this Obiection is preſently diſcouered, if only we obſerue the true natures of an Inſtitution, and of a Precept, which of themſelues are matters moſt diſtinct, for an Inſtitution is only a Production of a thing, wherby the nature and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the thing is eſtabliſhed and ordayned: and though the Inſtitution in the end be referred to the vſe of the thing, in that euery thing is for his vſe; yet the Inſtitution of it ſelf commandeth nothing concerning the vſe, wheras a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept further preſcribeth, whether, and how of neceſſity the thing is to be vſed. Matrimony for example is a thing ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God, and yet therfore all are not bound to mary, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet being maried, are they bound to vſe the ſame at all tymes, or in all ſortes, which according to Gods Inſtitution they lawfully might. And ſo all Creatures were by God or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſerue man, and yet all men are not bound therby to vſe them all. The like is in the preſent: Chriſt inſtituted the Euchariſt vnder both kinds, but thereupon it doth not follow, that therfore euery one is in ſuch ſort to receiue it, no more then becauſe Chriſt inſtituted this Sacrament after wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To come now to the ſecond Euaſion: that for Chriſt to be a Prieſt for euer, is not required a perpetuall Sacrifice by

But this auayleth nothing, for otherwiſe the Leuiticall Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, and all other Prieſts after the reſurrection, ſhould be called Prieſts for euer, becauſe they were Prieſts, and ſhall liue for euer; Neither is the perpetuity of the vertue of the Sacrifice vpon the Croſſe ſufficient to make Chriſt a Prieſt for euer, no more then the effect of Noes Sacrifice<note n="(14)" place="margin">

And in like ſort ſhould Chriſtes birth, paſſion, and death, be ſayd eternall, and Chriſt himſelfe to be euer borne, ſuffer, and dye, becauſe the effects of theſe remaine for euer: wherefore S. Paul requireth more, ſaying<note n="(15)" place="margin">

                     <hi>Euery high Prieſt is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to offer guiftes and Hoſts, wherefore it is neceſsary that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo haue ſome thing that he may offer.</hi> Wherfore if Chriſt ſhould not haue ſomething euer to offer, he ſhould not be ſaid to be a Prieſt for euer. Now, the Sacrifice of the Croſſe was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at once, and cannot be iterated, ſeeing Chriſt can dye no more, therfore ſome other daily and perpetuall Sacrifice muſt be admitted, and none other was euer heard of, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, but the Sacrifice of Chriſtes Body and Bloud, vnder the formes of Bread and wyne.</p>
                  <p>Neither may it be ſaid, that Chriſt is a Prieſt for euer, by any offering of himſelfe in heauen to God the Father, by his daily repreſenting to him his Paſſion for vs, for his Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation is not properly any Sacrifice, yea any lay man may daily preſent and offer to God the Paſſion of Chriſt, &amp; yet is not he therfore ſaid to be a Prieſt for euer.</p>

                  <p>Againe in the Scriptures, the word Sacrifice or Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not taken improperly, but when it hath ſomething adioyned vnto it, as the Sacrifice of Praiſe, of Iuſtice &amp;c. and ſo is ſufficiently declared to be taken for a ſpirituall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.

<pb n="636" facs="tcp:252:350"/> worke is meritorious, as it is a good worke done in Charity, and it is ſatisfactory, in that it is laborious and painfull. The like might be exemplified in <hi>Fasting</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The ſecond truth is, that a good worke in what reſpect it is meritorious, it cannot be applyed to others, but as it is ſatisfactory it may. The firſt part is cleere, for he is ſaid to merit who doth good, and by his good is worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but it cannot be ſaid becauſe one doth well, therfore another doth well, or is worthy of reward. Againe no man can be depriued of his owne merit, though he pray, faſt, &amp; giue Almes for others, wherfore he cannot communicate his merit with others. And this is that which the Scriptures teach when they ſay,<note n="(7)" place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8.</note> 
                        <hi>Euery one shall receiue his owne reward according to his owne labour.</hi> The ſecond part is alſo proued, for ſatisfaction is a releaſing of the Puniſhment, or paying of the debt: now, one may ſo ſatisfy for another mans puniſhment and pay his debt, that he may truly be ſaid to haue ſatisfyed and paid. Againe, he that ſatisfyeth for another, cannot by the ſame worke ſatisfye for himſelfe, therfore he truly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth his Satisfaction with another. A friend may with his owne money ſo ſatisfy another mans debt, that it will not ſerue alſo to pay his owne: but he cannot by his owne good workes deſerue, that another ſhalbe worthy of ſome great Office or Magiſtracy, which otherwiſe he were not worthy of.</p>
                     <p>But in further proofe that the workes of the iuſt may help others by way of impetration and ſatisfaction; it is to be remembred, that as God in his Iuſtice, doth puniſh ſome for the <hi>offences</hi> of others, and <hi>viſiteth</hi>

                     <p>S. Paul perſuadeth the rich Corinthians to releeue libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the poore Chriſtians in Hieruſalem, ſaying,<note n="(15)" place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.14.</note> 
                        <hi>Let in this preſent tyme your aboundance ſupply their want; that their aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance alſo may ſupply your want, that there be an equality.</hi> So plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth he teach, that the Satisfactory Deeds of one man, may be auaileable to others: yea, and that holy Saintes, or vertuous perſons may in meaſure and proportion of other mens neceſſities and deſeruings, allot vnto them, aſwell the Supererogation of their ſpirituall works, as theſe that abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in worldly goods may giue almes of the ſuperfluities to them which are in neceſſity: which enterchange, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and proportion of thinges the Apoſtle doth here euidently ſet downe.</p>
                     <p>The third truth to be proued is this, In the Church there is an infinite treaſure of ſatisfactions from the ſufferings of Chriſt, which can neuer be ſpent. Chriſt his Paſſion being the Paſſion of an Infinite perſon was of infinite valew, but the worth of Satisfaction receiueth its meaſure from the worth of the perſon ſatisfying, euen as the greatnes of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is meaſured by the worth of the perſon offended: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt his Paſſion or Satisfaction was of infinite value.</p>
                     <p>Againe, Chriſt ſuffered for all men (as is proued<note n="(16)" place="margin">See Hereafter chap. 30.</note> elswhere) but it is more then certaine, that to all thoſe who haue hitherto liued, Chriſt his ſufferings haue not bene actually applyed for the pardon of their ſinnes, the greater part being damned; wherfore much of that price remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, which may alwaies be applyed, though it were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, as indeed it is: And this the rather, ſeeing all the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt may be applyed to vs, himſelfe neuer ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, needing no ſatisfaction for himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>The fourth truth; To this Treaſure of ſuperaboundant Satisfactions, belong alſo the ſufferings of the B. V. Mary, and of all other Saintes, who haue ſuffered more then their ſinnes required. Suppoſing firſt, that Satisfaction for the fault and guilt of eternall puniſhment is not made by the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:252:351"/> of any Saintes, but only by the Bloud and ſuffering of Chriſt, the forſaid truth concerning the B.

                  <p>MAny do<note n="(1)" place="margin">Rogers Def. of the Art. art. 22. p. 123.</note> obiect, that our Doctrine of Indulgences doth derogate from the ſufficiency of Chriſtes Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Paſsion and Satisfaction, as though they without the Merits of Martyrs, Saintes, and our owne ſufferings, were not ſufficient to ſatisfy for the ſinnes of the whole world, wheras the Scriptures euery where teſtify, that Chriſt by his Bloud ſatisfyed for the ſinnes of the whole world. Anſw. All Catholickes confeſſe that Chriſt hath moſt fully ſatisfyed for the ſinnes of the world; but it doth not thence follow, that we are not to ſatisfy for the temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due vnto our ſinnes: euen as it is moſt true, that Chriſt by his Bloud merited for vs grace and glory, and yet we muſt ſeeke grace by faith and the Sacraments, and glory by ſtryuing and running for it. The reaſon herof is, becauſe the price of our Redemption and Satisfaction paid by Chriſt, profitteth only thoſe to whom it is applyed by certaine meanes or Inſtrumentes: for no other cauſe can be allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, why Pagans, Turkes, and Iewes are not ſaued, ſeeing Chriſt dyed and ſatisfyed for all. Now theſe meanes we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme to be Faith, Baptiſme, Contrition, Confeſſion and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: Neither do we adioyne theſe meanes to Chriſtes Satisfaction, as though this of it ſelfe were not ſufficient; but becauſe it pleaſed him to giue vs this power to ſatisfy, that the Efficacy of his Bloud might the more ſhine, when not
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:252:353"/> only himſelfe ſatisfyed, but that he communicated the power of Satisfaction, for temporall puniſhment, to his members.</p>
                  <p>Others obiect, that Durand and ſome other Catholicke writers do acknowledge that the Doctrine of Indulgences is not to be found in the Scriptures. Anſw. Though it be not taught in particular, and expreſſe wordes, which is all that Durand and others affirme, yet the grounds therof I haue formerly deduced out of the Scriptures. And though it were not at all in the Scriptures, yet thence it would not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it were a Doctrine humane and only Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, ſeeing many articles are belieued as diuine, which are no where taught in the Scriptures, as hath bene proued<note n="(2)" place="margin">See here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, chap. 7.</note> hertofore.</p>
                  <p>It is yet further vrged that ſome Indulgences haue been granted for 20000. yeares; whereas if any were to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſo long in Purgatory, doubtles they were to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed long after the day of Iudgement. Anſw. Some thinke there were neuer any ſo graunted by any Pope, but that they were forged by Officers for their profit: for Popes do but vſe to grant them for ſo many yeares, as Pennances were accuſtomed to be enioyned, which were for the moſt but for a mans life, which ordinarily is not aboue 100. yeares. But howſoeuer this be, it cannot be denyed, but that according to the Canons ſome deſerue Pennances for ſome thouſands of yeares; for if for one mortall ſinne, the Canons do enioyne ſometymes 3. yeares, ſometymes 7. for puniſhment, who is able to number the yeares, which according to the Canons were to be enioyned to ſuch as hourely ſweare, forſweare, blaſpheme, and frequently murther, rob &amp;c. And therefore if Indulgences of many thouſand yeares haue beene graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by any Pope, no doubt it was in this foreſaid reſpect. But as in this life many yeares Pennance may be ſatisfyed in one houre through the feruour of Charity and Contrition, ſo the vehemency of the paine in Purgatory, may ſatisfy in 300, or 400. yeares, that which otherwiſe might require 10000.</p>
                  <p>Others yet obiect, that ſome Indulgences do pardon
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:252:354"/> both the fault, and the puniſhment. Anſw. This is onely meant in reguard, that with Indulgence Confeſſion is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily ioyned, by which the fault is pardoned. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when it is ſaid, that by Indulgences ſinnes are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it is only vnderſtood in regard of the puniſhment, the fault being ſuppoſed to be formerly forgiuen by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Pennance.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, the ſame is cleerly taught in theſe wordes of S. Iames,<note n="(12)" place="margin">
                        <hi>C.</hi> 1. 14. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Euery one is tempted of his owne Concupiſcence, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted, and allured; Afterwardes Concupiſcence when it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued bringeth forth Sinne; but ſinne when it is conſummate engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth Death.</hi> Heere 4. things are diſtinguiſhed, Concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, that is a power of coueting prone to euill, and her 3. motions, Suggeſtion, Delectation, and Conſent. Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence and her firſt motion S. Iames doth not call Sinne, but a Temptation to ſinne. Delight, but not fully deliberate, he calleth ſinne, but not mortall: which only full Conſent cauſeth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Concupiſcence is the effect and Puniſhment of Originall ſinne. Ergo it cannot be the Originall ſinne it ſelfe; for although one and the ſame thing may be ſinne, and the puniſhment of ſinne, yea &amp; the cauſe alſo, yet this is euer in diuers reſpects; for it cannot be conceiued that one thing may be ſinne, and the puniſhment and effect of the ſame ſinne, becauſe it ſhould be puniſhment and effect of it ſelfe, and, by this, be before, and after it ſelfe. Now that Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence is the puniſhment and effect of ſinne originall, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by S. Paul, ſaying,<note n="(13)" place="margin">

<pb n="660" facs="tcp:252:362"/> is <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> with <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and other wounds infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cted vpon our nature: ſo that the ſame reaſon is of <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> and <hi>Death:</hi> wheras <hi>Death</hi> is a Puniſhment and effect of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne, ſo likewiſe is <hi>Concupiſcence.</hi> And ſo in expreſſe wordes S.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Concupiſcence is the punishment of Sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if Concupiſcence be taken for the inuolunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act, that is, for the firſt motions of Concupiſcence to which the mynd reſiſteth, it is no ſinne, as is cleere in Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Madmen, and Sleepers, in whoſe power it is not, not to haue the Acts of Concupiſcence. Ergo much leſſe it is ſinne if it be taken for the proneſſe &amp; inclination to ſinne. But neither is it in the power of wyſe and aged men not to haue the firſt motions of Concupiſcence: Ergo, neither is it ſinne in them. Beſides Gods law is not only poſſible, but ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy to thoſe who are indued with Gods grace: but it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, without particular Priuiledge from God, for euen the Iuſt not to haue the firſt motions of Concupiſcence reſiſting the law of their mind, as experience teacheth, and S. Paul himſelfe proued, when he ſaid,<note n="(15)" place="margin">

                     <hi>I am delighted with the law of God, according to the inward man: but I ſee another law in my members, repugning to the law of my mynd, and captiuing me in the law of ſinne, that is in my members.</hi> The ſame alſo is confirmed by thoſe wordes of S. Paul,<note n="(16)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17.18.</note> 
                     <hi>But now, not I worke it any more, but the ſinne that dwelleth in me, for I know that there dwelleth not in me, that is to ſay in my flesh, good.</hi> Theſe words are ſpoken of S. Paul himſelfe, or any other iuſt perſon, in whom Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence cannot properly be ſinne, becauſe here it is ſaid that the motion of Concupiſcence is not his worke, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be imputed to him to ſinne, ſeeing it is not his. Againe, he affirmeth that this euill is not in him, but in his fleſh, wheras it is certaine that the fleſh is not capable of ſinne properly taken.</p>
                  <p>Neither will it ſuffice to anſwere with Caluin,<note n="(17)" place="margin">
                        <hi>Inſt. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. §. 9.</note> that by <hi>flesh,</hi> is vnderſtood here the whole man, as he is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Nature corrupted. For if it were ſo to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, then S. Paul had not truly ſaid, <hi>not I worke it,</hi> for how did not he worke that, which the whole man, body, and
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:252:362"/> ſoule worketh? But if reaſon reſiſting, which is the chiefeſt part of man, the onely inferiour part doth worke, then it may be truly ſaid, <hi>not I worke it.</hi> Secondly, to what end ſhould he haue ſaid, as it were by way of Correction, <hi>I know that there dwelleth not in me, that is in my flesh good,</hi> if that euill were in the whole man? Thirdly, S. Paul diſtinguiſheth in expreſſe wordes, the fleſh from the mynd, ſaying. <hi>I ſee</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>All this is yet further eſtabliſhed by theſe other wordes of the Apoſtle<note n="(20)" place="margin">

<pb n="695" facs="tcp:252:379"/> impertinent; for firſt before all concourſe of the ſunne, it is ſuppoſed, that the Body is already dead &amp; diſpoſed to corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, for in a ſound body the ſunne beames cannot produce any ſuch effect: but according to Prot. God moued Adam &amp; Sathan to ſinne, when they were in perfect and innocent ſtate. Secondly the ſunne is only an vniuerſall cauſe, which intendeth not corruption, but heate, which heate of it ſelfe is indifferent to produce different Effects, and is limited and determined by ſecondary and particular cauſes to produce rather one effect then another, as might be exemplifyed in an Apple, or perfume, and a dead Carcaſe, wheras according to them, God concurreth particularly, intending, comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>Thirdly, it yet further followeth of this forſaid doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of Prot. that God alone doth only ſinne and not man: for it is moſt cleere and certayne, that no man can ſinne in that which he cannot poſſibly eſchew, but of neceſſity is forced to do: But according to<note n="(8)" place="margin">De Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid. c. <hi>6.</hi> Calu.

                  <p>Caluin and Chemnitius anſwere, that theſe wordes are vttered by the holy Ghoſt, not that there is any danger, that the faythfull ſhall fall from ſaluation, but only to ſhake of the ſlouth and carnall ſecurity of men negligent in doing good workes. But though it be true, that thoſe who are predeſtinate ſhall not fall from Saluation, and that the holy Ghoſt doth ſpeake theſe wordes to ſtirre vp the Elect to care and diligence, yet they cannot be vnderſtood of thoſe who certainly know and belieue their Predeſtination, but of ſuch as are ignorant thereof: for theſe who are ſo certaine cannot feare the loſſe of Saluation, yea they ought not to feare it, if they as certainly belieue it, as they belieue Chriſt to be God: and therefore the holy Ghoſt ſhould exhort them to Infidelity, when he exhorteth them to feare the loſſe of their Saluation: euen as he ſhould do the lyke, who ſhould exhort a Chriſtian to feare whether Chriſt were God. Wherefore ſeeing by theſe places we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:252:406"/> to feare, we neither ought nor can firmly belieue, that we are certainly of the number of the Predeſtinate, and of thoſe that infallibly are to be ſaued.</p>
                  <p>And Reaſon conuinceth this truth: for nothing can be certaine with certainty of faith, but what is either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly contained in the word of God, or by euident conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence deduced from thence; but this particular propoſition, <hi>Luther is predestinate,</hi> is neither of the former waies proued from the Scripture: for that which in this point can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from thence is, that ſuch as belieue, and repent, and ſo continue, ſhall certainly be ſaued, and ſo are predeſtinate.

When then the Apostle ſaith, that he accounteth a man to be iuſtifyed by faith without workes of the law, he doth not this, that faith being obtained and profeſsed, the workes of Iuſtice should be contemned, but that euery one may know, that he may be iuſtifyed by faith, although the workes of the law be not precedent. For they follow him that is iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifyed, do not go before him that is to be iustifyed &amp;c. Therfore becauſe this opinion was then begunne, the other Apoſtolicall Epiſtles of Peter, Iohn, Iames, Iude, do chiefly direct their intention against it, that they may strongly confirme, that Faith without workes doth profit nothing: Euen alſo, as Paul himſelfe hath not defyned any fayth whatſoeuer wherby God is belieued, but that wholſome and plainly Euangelicall, whoſe workes proceed of loue;<note n="(3)" place="margin">
